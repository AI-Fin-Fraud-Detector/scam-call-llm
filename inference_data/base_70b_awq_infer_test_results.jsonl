How do I take care of myself?\ncaller: I've been working out a lot, and as a woman, I've noticed that I'm dieting, so I try to do a lot of aerobic exercise, aerobic exercise makes me feel better, I feel healthy, I feel like I'm losing weight, and I don't like exercise, but I do it for health reasons, and I'm not particularly sick or anything, and these days I like to ride a bike, so I'm cycling around a lot, but I think that's the health care of today, and there's no such thing as being particularly sick.\nreceiver: I've ordered five pills lately, and they're called Omega, Milk Thistle, Bacillus, Lutein, and what have you. There were five of them, and there was one, but I'm on five pills, and I'm trying to take them all at once, and I think it's going to be a little bit of a burden on my body, so I'm just trying to make sure that I take them one at a time, and I don't feel the effects of those pills yet, but I think if I keep taking them, I'm going to feel better, especially after I eat milk thistle, I think I'm a little less tired, and I feel satisfied, so why don't you go on a diet instead of trying to lose weight and build a healthy body?\ncaller: I don't know if you think that a healthy body is just a body that doesn't hurt and is strong, but women have a feminine point of view and they want a body that is a little bit more beautiful and a little bit sharper, so I do gymnastics, but I went to the gym to make a beautiful body, but I didn't see much effect, so I no longer go to the gym, I take a lot of drugs, but I have never experienced any side effects, because health supplements are drugs.\nreceiver: I don't think there's a lot of side effects, but I've had a little bit of an uneasy feeling in my stomach, especially if I take it right before I go to sleep.\ncaller: It's a lot of fun, because it's more fun because you can pedal, and you can see the scenery and you can ride for three or four hours, and then the next day it's not so hard, so I'm trying to run every weekend, and these days I'm sweating a lot in the summer, so I don't run very well, and I'm thinking about what I can do to make more use of my bike.\nreceiver: Of all the things I've eaten, milk thistle seems to be the most effective, and if I want to eat more in the future, it's expensive, but I think kale is good for my body. I don't have a fever and I'm cold-tolerant. If you eat kale nutrition, it will warm your body and help your health, so I think it's good to eat kale, but if you eat kale, you'll live longer and get older, and that's what they say.\ncaller: The farthest I've ever gone was in April, and it took me two hours to get there and back, not two hours, but four hours, and the people I was running with were all grasshoppers, but I had more fun, and I could run again the next day, and the next day I ran to the planet, and so I ran another three hours, and then I ran seven hours over the weekend, and I thought it would be tough on a Monday, but it's okay, because I'm a rider, and it's the best sport that I can think of, so I have to keep going.\nreceiver: I've never had a major illness, but I've had a major injury, and I sprained my ankle playing basketball, and my left ankle was dislocated for about four weeks, and it was very swollen and painful, so I was in the hospital, and I continued to be treated, and I got injections, and I was able to recover, and that's when I got the biggest injury.\ncaller: I don't think exercise is the only thing that's important, I think it's important to have a regular lifestyle, like the time you wake up in the morning, the time you go to sleep at night, a consistent lifestyle, a regular meal time, etc. I felt that it was important, because I felt that if I didn't do it, my body wouldn't be able to keep up with me, because a consistent life is like the basics of health care, and then exercise, and then dieting, and then building muscle, and maybe it's the same for everyone, so I'm trying to be consistent, and it's not as easy as I thought it would be, but when it comes to certain medications and health foods that people talk about, I usually just eat them.\nreceiver: I'm a bit of a cautious person, and I don't want to mimic the way people eat, but after a long time, I'm going to take some time to see if there are any side effects, and then I'll see if it works for me, and I'll think about it carefully, and then if I want to feel better, I'll choose a drug, and I think that's the part of my body that I feel the healthiest about, and the part that I'm not.\ncaller: It's too organically connected to say that we're healthy with just one part, but we've never been particularly sick, and if we say we're particularly strong, I wonder if it's the lower body. Well, once you've walked a lot, it's not that hard, and you've cycled a lot, but it's also not that hard. The weaker part is the lower body, and the weaker part seems to be the weaker bronchial system, and when it's autumn and winter, there's a little bit of a cold, and a lot of diarrhea, and so you have to eat a lot of warm things, and what I want is cold drinks, and I don't like to drink a lot of hot drinks, so from this year on, I'm trying to have a lot of healthy things, like tea, and I haven't had a major illness, and if I say I've had a major injury, I've been living cautiously with that injury.\nreceiver: My favorite areas to hurt are my ankles and my knees, and I'm very active, so I try not to hurt myself, but it seems like there's injuries, so I'm more careful these days, because I'm stretching more carefully before I exercise, and I do my best not to get hurt, and if I used to just look at the ball and blow my body, then I'm a little bit more relaxed, and I have less desire to exercise, so I think I'm less injured than before.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Yeah, I remember. I was just watching baseball.\nreceiver: Well, in my case, yeah, but I think there's this thing where I'm a fan of a guy who was in Lotte, and he moved to another team, and he's like, these days, uh, I'm not a fan of any one player, I just like all the Lotte players.\ncaller: I don't really like sports, but we all love football, so we watch a lot of football at home and abroad, and our groom likes it so much that he wakes up in the morning and we watch it together.\nreceiver: I guess I wasn't very interested in football, but I think I got a little bit interested in it when our country hosted the 2002 World Cup in our country, so whatever the Red Devils were, I really remember that I was just running around with my mom and my mom at the supermarket at that time, so I don't really go out, and there's really no one around, and I remember that I remember that when I talk about sports, I remember that her boyfriend, who she met before we got married, liked to go rafting, so I remember going rafting with his friends, and it was so much fun, so I still think about what it would be like if we went rafting.\ncaller: I didn't hate it so much in the old days, but now I feel like when I go to the amusement park, it's scary to ride that kind of thing, and it gets scarier and scarier, and I don't feel like I'm really good at it, and I feel like I get a little bit more and more scared, and I'm like, \"Oh, so it's just stability and cycling and stuff like that, and that's okay, because I used to do lifting, I think, because I had the opportunity to do group lifting in the company, but then I hated it so much as a child that I didn' t want to go along with it, and yeah, I remember it was too much of a regret, because after that time, I don' t have much of a chance to do it, and so where did I go?\nreceiver: I remember when we were rafting, there were about five of us on that boat, and then one of the assistants got on it, and then our team got on it and then there was another team, and then we got on the rafting boat, and I was a little bit unprepared, and when I got on the boat, the water kept splashing in the faces of the other rafting teams that came alongside, and then you see each other, our team, and the other team, and a little bit of that kind of splashing, and we were having a lot of fun, and we weren't rafting with each other, and the big guy just kept blowing up the water.\ncaller: I used to go to the countryside a lot when I was in college to ride a bike, and I still have those memories, and I had a giant hump like a hummingbird that I borrowed with our kids, and I rode it, but I didn't ride much, and I don't like to move very much, because it's all the groom's business, so I'm waiting, because we can't ride the bike yet, and we just go there.\nreceiver: I don't go to the gym these days, so I guess it's kind of like a home run or a little bit of cycling, but you have to be a little bit diligent, and you have a little hobby, and that's what you have to do, and I'm not a big fan of exercising, so I think that's why you don't do well.\ncaller: I don't think I've been very good at sports since I was a kid. I'm not very interested in sports. Luckily, our kids are very into sports. Our second child was a boy. We had a soccer game at that time.\nreceiver: I've been doing a little bit of yoga, and I've learned that when you're doing yoga, you feel like you're working on your body and your mind a little bit at a time, and you're feeling a little bit purified a little bit by the body and the mind, and the mind and the body together.\ncaller: Oh, I do Pilates-like yoga besides yoga, and I've done it with swimming and gymnastics, but gymnastics doesn't allow me to do it consistently, so I went and I said, \"Well, this is something that unless a trainer sticks, I'm doing it on my own, so I don't have to work so hard\", and then I didn't do it for a month, and then a month after that, and the pool was really fun, and then I was just in a hurry, and since then I guess I haven't been able to go, because I have time constraints and I'm raising artificial children, and that takes up a lot of my time, and I don' t want to go in the morning, and I was too sleepy in the morning and I couldn' t get up in the morning.\nreceiver: I think it's a little early in the morning and it's my time, so I've been exercising a little bit in the morning, and I think if I exercise in the morning I feel a little bit more energized in the day, so I like exercising in the morning a little bit, but when I wake up in the morning it seems to be a little bit difficult.\ncaller: Yeah, I used to go to Lotte World and shoot kids at the Lotte ice rink. I saw that and I thought a lot about how my kids could do it too. Since I was a kid, I've been doing things that improve endurance and I like them a lot, but I didn't do it because they don't really like it, but there was a boy next door who was the same age as my older brother, and then he became a household name, and then I went to the ice rink in the pasture for a month or two, and I worked hard, but I lost weight on purpose.\nreceiver: In the case of my kids, they're probably in private school, so in private school they're a little bit more focused on learning to play instruments, like piano or violin, and sports are crazy elementary school, and skateboarding is a little bit popular among sports, so there's an ice rink, so kids in the school play hockey, ice hockey, and skate a little bit, and it's a little bit like this, so the kids are a little bit skilled in that kind of skating, and they've been doing it since they were young, and it looks a little bit good, so in the case of private school, it's kind of like teaching a little bit of second language to kids, or sports, or instruments, and so in a little bit you're a bit less self-educated, but in school, you feel a little bit less like you've been to a big game recently, because you haven't been to a lot of games lately.\ncaller: I spent a lot of time with the cooking kids and basketball, but I only spent time with the kids because I didn't go, so I had the opportunity to watch a lot of football and basketball and baseball, especially baseball, which is what I remember most, in the old days, I went with my second and only two of us, and Esquire was number one for a long time, but my badge was Esquire, and then Esquire sat down and cheered, and then I was number one, and just this and that cheering handkerchief, because I liked it so much, so I remembered a lot of that time, and yes, I remember a lot of other things, and that's all I remember. Do you remember any of the things you went to see when you were cheering?\nreceiver: I mean, I'm a girl, and I've never seen a kid play baseball, or watched a kid play in front of them, but they're kids, and my husband loves kids, and he's very intuitive, and he goes there to be intuitive, so he's kind of a locker room guy, so when he can't get tickets, it's a little bit difficult, and sometimes he has to go buy tickets from people who are looking for tickets, and so our family thought we should give the kids a little bit of the husband, and the kids should have some sports, so the kids were a little bit younger, and the wife was a little bit older, and she learned to watch the baseball from her husband, so a little bit better.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

How about you?\nreceiver: It's good, so I don't eat it because I think it's cheap these days, but I also read the article because these days, with the expansion of the food facilities, the overalls are much cheaper, and the Chinese and Japanese exports have dropped a lot, and the mountains have fallen a lot, I said I've never experienced that, but it's a bit unfortunate, when there are so many, I want to eat a little cheaper, but it is a pity that I didn't, but I wonder why it doesn't fall like this, I think it will, and I think why it does not fall like this and keep falling, but the price will not fall, how do you think\ncaller: It's a very expensive product, so I think a lot of people are going to have to pay a lot of fees or whatever, so it's not going to go down in price, because it's going to eliminate a lot of the distribution margin in the middle, like a supermarket or a normal retail store, so obviously you're going to be able to buy it cheaply at A-Mart, and that might make you wonder why it's so expensive at a normal grocery store.\nreceiver: I almost went out and bought it, but I didn't buy it because I wasn't greasy, so at first I liked it, and it's good for heat, and now it's baby food, so it tends to be expensive, but we keep buying it, and now when guests come to the mainland, we think about it so much, so we really like it, and when the mainland comes, we have this illusion of the people on the mainland that it's a very expensive outfit, and I don't think I've ever bought anything, but I think that if we improve this flow structure a little bit more, we can eat well in the future, and when people from the mainland come, we can use it tasty enough, and now we can sell it to each other.\ncaller: The last time I went to an I.M.A.T. store, it was about 30,000 won per kilo, but this is a really old-fashioned price, and I don't think I would have thought it was 50,000 won before, but now that I think about it, the price of most of the food has dropped a lot these days because of the new coronavirus, but of course, in the supermarkets, the distribution process has also been reduced, but you can consume the leftover food in other restaurants, because people are observing social distancing these days, so you don't go to restaurants often, so you have to consume in those restaurants, and it's very difficult to dispose of waste like this sweater.\nreceiver: I don't know about the prices, but I think I've seen a lot of shops where you can buy clothes that are so cheap, and I'm sure you've never seen a store like that. If you've been to the mall, you've seen these big shirts.\ncaller: Well, if you go up to the one-room hospital, there's a place that sells uniforms, but it's weird because there are a lot of townspeople there, and tourists know how to buy them, so they buy a lot of them. So I think I've also made a little bit of a difference in the distribution margin, so I said, \"Well, the prices are much lower, so tourists also listen to the insider information, and we go there to buy them.\nreceiver: It's true that in Jeju Island, they used to make kim-bombs out of overcoats, and now they make kim-bobs out of them, and now there's a lot of use for things like overcoats that are now on top of the food like kare, but when I think about it, there was a perception that overcoats were very expensive, and that one meal wasn't that expensive, so there was also something like Instagram or something on the ground, and it seems to have been a hot spot where people go a lot, and I think there was also a lot of usage for overcoats.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

So he said, \"We can't be allied with communism, we want to change the destiny of Brazil\", and I think that's why I think that the composition of this person is that the national infrastructure and industry are not developing in the process of pouring the national budget into the Bolsa Família Fomí system, which supports the low-income poor, because the economic situation of the leftist regime has brought the populist populists of the extreme right. This is how it came out.\ncaller: Yes, in Brazil, for 13 years now, the Workers' Party has been in power, and now we have a new government, and as you said, I'm in an economic crisis, and I think it's not too irresponsible to make such a commitment to support the vulnerable, but I thought that this president is still in power, but he's still providing some support to the elderly, and there are rumors that he's giving some support to elderly people, so the elderly people have some level of living standards, but the problem is, as you say, it's spending the money of the country, rather than raising the national debt, and seeing that, it seems that the party is too focused on the elections of the people in power, so it doesn't really think about the situation in the country, so it's going to continue to cause this kind of problem.\nreceiver: Yes, and I said to a female congressman that I don't deserve to be sexually assaulted, and oh, this is really worse than Trump, and Trump in the United States doesn't talk about this, and when he accepts this, how will the person who accepts this think, so this is really impossible, and there are people in our country, among our congressmen, who say the same thing, so I think this is something that is not only sexual harassment, but it's a matter of harming his self-esteem, and this is a matter of hurting his self-respect.\ncaller: And then there's this other thing that the president has been talking about recently, which is that he's got coronavirus, but he's not wearing a mask, and he's still working, and there's a lot of people who have died from coronavirus in Brazil, and he said, well, you know, they're idiots when you ask them what they think of people like that, and it makes me think that maybe he doesn't mean to be violent, but that maybe he's really just being violent because he has these values in his mind.\nreceiver: Yes, it's not only Brazil that doesn't wear a mask, but President Trump of the United States doesn't even wear a mask. And I think it's ridiculous that the president of this country, who is the sovereign of the country, does not wear a mask because I think that's absurd. So this is an example for the president, and I think all citizens should follow.\ncaller: That's right, and the office of the president is no longer a place to indulge your own political desires, it's now a place to think about the people, to represent the country first, to take care of the different parts of the country, and I hope you'll take good care of that.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

I used to love chocolate cake when I was a kid, but now I've gotten away from it, and now I like ice cream cake and fruit cake more than moonshine chocolate. Recently, I've had a cake, I think it was a week ago, and I ordered a cake from my friend's hand, and we both ate it.\ncaller: I'm a big fan of chocolate cake because I like it to be delicious, but if I had to eat cake, I'd choose chocolate cake, but I don't really like the cake itself, which, as this article says, has a psychological effect on the price. It's just that I'm the kind of guy who doesn't take cake for birthdays, and apparently these four brothers have a particularly tight relationship, so they don't take birthdays for each other.\nreceiver: I'm a big fan of having cake in the cafeteria when I'm with my friends, and pretty cakes are just as popular as good cakes these days, and I also want to make sure that pretty cakes have pretty cakes, and I think a lot of people in cafeterias and cafeterias, when they're talking about drinks and cakes in Essence, and they're often visiting cafeterias like this, they have to pay attention to the visual aspect of cakes. And I think it's understandable that cakes are so ridiculously expensive, and that sliced cakes cost a lot of money these days, because in the past you could eat them on 5,000 ships, but now they're almost as expensive as cake, and I've seen cakes that are more expensive than cake, but I think there's also a publicity effect to these cakes, because I think pretty cakes taste good, even though they're so expensive, and people take a lot of pictures of them, and I don't think they're cheap, like in the newspapers, and it's important to share photos of these cakes\ncaller: Yes, I used to take pictures of food, of course, and I didn't really take pictures of people, but now that I've gotten older, I realize that when you think about the past, if you have a photo, you can recall the past more vividly, and you can remember things like emotions at that time, and I've started to get a little habit of taking pictures to remember things more vividely. Recently, I've been meeting with friends, and of course, they're trying to figure out whether or not to take a group photo, trying to get together and take a group picture, trying to post something on Esquire while eating, even if you're a knight in shining armour, and it doesn't mean that you have to take anything, but there are some things that can be really good memories, such as when you get together with your friends, or when you don't have an album or something like that, and then you say that you've eaten something tasty, or you've heard about a cake, or you have a memory, and you're wondering why you can afford to buy these things\nreceiver: Yes, I would like to try a cake in the hockey hotel industry that emphasizes the limited edition like the article, which is normally annoying to eat, but the Secret Box Santa's Kevin Cake, which was released by Ah Hotel on a special day like an anniversary or a birthday, I'd like to try one of these expensive cakes, and I think it's going to be just as good as the expensive cake, and it's also a good memory to try a few unusable cakes on a cherished anniversary.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

then the Phosphorus incident broke out in Seoul, and I canceled again in September, so I didn't go anywhere.\nreceiver: I went to Shanghai, China, at the beginning of 2019, and I was a little bit

to Shanghai, but I don't know if the person in front of me recently traveled abroad or not.\ncaller: I went to Russia last winter, and I took the transoceanic train, and it was fun, but it wasn't that winter, so there were no soldiers, and there were no famous soldiers on YouTube, and then I took the trensocean train from Moscow, and now I went to Iceland, and Iceland is really, really expensive, so Iceland is a little bit in the sunlight, so it's a little bit too expensive to see the aurora, and Russia is really strong, so it is really fun to take the transocesan train in Russia, and I recommend it, and I've been to Europe a lot, and I have been to Europe.\nreceiver: I wanted to go to Europe, but I didn't have the money, so I saved up a lot of money, and I spent it all on studying, and I never really went to Europe, and if you've ever been to Europe, have you ever been anywhere other than Iceland or Russia?\ncaller: Oh, yeah, that's Europe, it's the usual clockwise direction, and I've been to England, and I just started here, and I really liked Spain and Switzerland, but Paris is really dirty, and there are a lot of rats, and now it's so different from what I thought it would be, and I was really disappointed, but it was beautiful, and it was beautiful on the streets, and I thought Spain was really not that crowded, and the people were a little bit bad, and I couldn't get off the bus, and the Spanish guy, the locals, they let me open the door, and they let me off, and they were okay with it, so I recommend Spain and Switzerland a lot, and Switzerland is a little bit too good for nature, and it's fun to do rock festivals and stuff, so I really recommend you go to Switzerland.\nreceiver: I've never traveled to Europe in my case, and I've only been to places that are a little bit closer, like China or Japan, and I haven't traveled for a long period of time, but I've heard on the Internet that it's a lot of hard times when you're traveling for an extended period of time.\ncaller: I had a bit of a crush on my friend when we were traveling on the train, but my friend was a little bit different physically, and I like to walk or travel, so I keep walking and I like that, and my friend said it's a little bit difficult because it's my first trip to Europe, so it's kind of hard, but I don't have a difference in my body or my taste, and now I'm all about eating well, and I don' t like this, so it was a bit uncomfortable, but when I got hurt, I went short, so I went with my friend.\nreceiver: Yeah, I went with a lot of people when I was injured, because normally it's two people, but when I went, it was five people, and at first it was a little bit awkward because of the hostel room issue, but it was a big room, and it had a little bit of a bad facility, and I had a poorly equipped room, and I felt a little bit uncomfortable, so now that I think about it, I kind of felt sorry for them, and, uh, you know, I talked a lot about flavor, and I was in China, and the food didn't quite fit in my mouth, and I kind of struggled a little bit, and I thought, like, in the case of Dimm Island, there's a lot of spices in there, and when we get off at the airport, the smell of the spices is moving around, so it was kind of a little bit difficult, so I guess, if you want to talk about taste, I remember having tasted something like that in Europe.\ncaller: I've been to Europe, and it's okay, because I eat a lot of cornmeal and pasta and things like that in Korea, and I've also been to Taiwan and Hong Kong, well, I had a little bit of a bad memory, and I could smell this spice, like you said, and I went to Hong Kong with my mom, and it smelled so bad, and it was so bad, because it smelled like thimble and all that stuff, and so I was drinking tea, and I was a little bit okay, but Hong Kong and Taiwan rights and stuff don't really go well together, and Shanghai is a little bit famous for its wildlife and stuff, and the buildings are so beautiful, so I want to go to Shanghai, and they were all a little bit cool, and I didn't know if I was going to go there, there was any kind of grossness or anything like that.\nreceiver: Shanghai didn't have retail, and if you're a little bit upset about it, it's known as a big city in China, and it's a little bit nice, but it's not like that, and it is very well decorated, and the other part of it is a little bit like a slum, so it wasn't completely free of the kind of prejudice that I thought it would be, but I thought a little bit, and there were a lot of similar parts, like people, I think you definitely do a lot of shrimping, but I don't know, let's take a picture.\ncaller: I mean, the locals were all fine, and it was a little bit of a rough patch, I guess, but it's just that they're usually known for being the worst flies, and at first, you know, there's a spring wire on a spring phone, and then there's this thing where you have to sign something, and then you have to go through your bag and steal it, and a lot of this stuff, and I've been lucky enough to have a lot of preparation, and I haven't been caught doing any of that stuff, and then, uh, one of my best memories is when I'm carrying Carrie down the stairs like this, and she's so cool, she's wearing this really cool suit, and my husband just grabs her, and she just goes down the staircase and she just cools off, so, uh, I thought the locals weren't all bad, and I was going to go to Shanghai this year, but then I said, well, it's a little bit rough around the edges, so I had a couple of knocks.\nreceiver: I think I was there for five or six days, and I got there late at night, and I came back early, and I was homeless at the airport on the last day, so I think it's only about four days in China, and I'm sure the floor is a little bit dirty, and the bathroom, to be honest, I thought it was clean, but that's the Nordic standard, and I actually went to the bathroom and it was a little dirty and I was shocked, because I had just gone to the toilet, and there was a lot of water on the toilet tiles, and the water was a strange color, so if you're sensitive to the bathrooms, I think it would be a good idea not to go to the public bathroom.\ncaller: Yeah, I think it's because they're usually Arab or South American kids, but now they're not white, they're just a little bit more South-Central, so it's a little bit different, but when you go there, you're with your family, and that's how it is, and I think that's why I've seen a lot of tourist destinations in Europe where they're branded and they can't go to school, so it was a little bit of an inescapable dilemma, but it didn't work out, because they don't want their children to get an education, and it's kind of sad, but some parents seem to have no choice in the matter, and that was a little sad, but now my friends are about to get hurt, and Aaron doesn't look any worse than that,

I haven't been, and yes, I'd like to go, too, but I can't go now because the government is a little bad these days, and my memories of my school days are not only in university, but also in high school.\ncaller: When I think about it, when I was in high school, I was probably with my friends from morning till night, so I'm more familiar and I have more memories, and I brought this book with me, as I said, and now the teachers, now the rich teachers, if they supervised Yaja, they would sneak it out and then they would get caught and get drunk, but did you leave it out?\nreceiver: No, I'm an engineering graduate, and like you said, if you see a teacher who can hit a pitcher, you run away, and that's what we had. And then the dean of students came and picked us up the next day, and we were just batting.\ncaller: Now that's right, and I'm right, that's the way it is, instead of taking off the shirt and hitting it, you just take off the shirt, you just clean it with a bee, or you just take care of it a little bit more tightly, and it doesn't exactly fit like that, and we've done the pants, and when you do the pants, the head of the class, if you're just coming into the class, you go up on the desk, and we take off your shoes, and you get up on the table, and then you take them off, and now you're measuring the centimeter, and now, you're hitting above the knee, and you take them out, and you're doing a little bit of the pants-cutting.\nreceiver: Yeah, I think we had a change of clothes in high school, but we didn't have a separate change of clothes, and I think our hair was all dyed brown, and we had no change of clothes. And I remember when I was in middle school, the teachers said that I had to cut my jeans because they would find them and cut them off, and if I had a hair like that, they wouldn't let me dye them anymore, and I don't think we had any change of clothes at all in high school.\ncaller: I went to middle school in engineering, and I went to junior high, and there's this thing called \"leadership\", so third graders are now leading, and then they're leading, and they're having a little fun, and then you go over the fence, and you go out for lunch, and you eat hamburgers, and I think that's what you did a lot of in second grade, and in third grade, you see your friends leading, and it just kind of came naturally.\nreceiver: Yeah, I didn't, and I'm talking about the leader, and I remember that the leader was only a year older than me when he took over, and our school didn't have a wall, and when we were in high school, we would intentionally try to make fun of the leader, we would step on the brick, and then we would jump back and make fun of him, and then you would ask the leader to let you out because he was going to buy you an ice cream, and then he'd say, \"You're right\", and then you'd ask the teacher again, and now you're going to ask him out, and now I did, and you mentioned hamburgers, and I used to eat hamburgers at lunch, and I would get stuck in an elevator at school, and then I'd be late for school, in case I missed school or was late.\ncaller: I'm a person with a spinal cord injury, and if I didn't get sick or something like that, I think school was really good, because I went to high school at a charter school on Canal Street, and I went to middle school at a former junior high school in the business district, and I wonder where you went to school.\nreceiver: I'm a graduate of Shinga Middle School and Suwan High School, and I've been to the Central High School and the Gold Coast High School with the secretary and the goldsmith factory, and I just heard that the school said that Gold Coast and Central High School don't work well together, is that true?\ncaller: When we get to the gate, our school is the lowest, and then there's Central High School behind our school, and oh, the highest one is Gold Coast, which is famous for its football, so that's why the gymnasium is made of grass, and it's a very good gymnasium, but in comparison, Central Central and our school used to use that gymnasium together, but it's made of dirt, and I don't like it, so we have Gold Coast Gymnasium, which is a little higher than our gymnasium.\nreceiver: We had a school that was just our school at the beginning, and we didn't have anything like that, or whistle-blowing, or anything like that. Anyway, I'm an engineer, so you talked about fast food, and now we don't have much of a taste for fast food, because Wednesday is the last day of the week, and we eat all of it.\ncaller: I'm, uh, I'm in the middle, and, uh, we have all these nutrition teachers in the cafeteria, but the high-school nutrition teacher, she's really bad at this, and she screams a lot when she doesn't stand up straight, and the ladies who cook are really nice, and the nutrition is really bad, and that's why I don't eat any more, and I guess I just went out and bought food, and in middle school, I think it was just for fun.\nreceiver: Uh, high school uniforms, we're kind of this pretty side, you know, when you hit the fourth quarter, you're gonna get a pretty hoodie, but when we were in middle school, we used to have black underneath it, and it used to be like, I mean, it was like that gangster outfit, and our school was known as a little bad school in the school district, and now they're trying to fix it, and now we've changed the uniforms, and then all of a sudden, the uniforms have been replaced by the shit-colored uniforms and the uniforms are a little unattractive, so I think the old uniforms were nicer, and I think the uniforms were fine when I was in high school, but what about the uniforms on the other side?\ncaller: When I was in middle school, I probably wore a lot of sweatpants, and I wore very few sweatpans, or a lot of gym clothes, and I don't think I was very pretty either, I just had a black shirt and red check shirts, and my high school sweatpant was not very pretty, and my tie was green like a caterpillar, and my underwear was one of those girls' jeans that had wrinkles on the front and back, but it used to be wrinkled on the front only, and our school sweats were wrinkled back and forth, and now when the wind blows or when it blows, it flies back and forth like that, and I didn't like that.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

I have a friend who likes dogs, and I don't like dogs that much, but I like cats more than dogs, and my friend has a dog, but that dog hasn't been allowed to walk since he was a little kid, and now that he's grown up, he barks so much when he sees people, and when he sees a dog barking, and he barks like this, he doesn't want to walk anymore.\nreceiver: I love cats so much, I'd like to have more of them these days, but I'm going to make them a little bit bigger, and when the time comes, I'm planning on having a cat, because originally dogs were so attached to people, but now they're like this, and this, and that, and that used to be nice, but now it's like this, a little bit like a cat, an independent kid, and they're comfortable, so now I'm thinking about having a cat in a couple of years.\ncaller: I don't know about breeding, but I think Russian Blue is a good breed, because it's the least disease-prone of all the cats, so I think it's a good idea to breed it to be the least sick and the healthiest.\nreceiver: I don't know exactly, but a friend of mine is raising two dogs and two cats right now, and that didn't seem like a big deal, but, uh, I just thought we were raising a cat, and I think we haven't really thought about that part yet with our dogs.\ncaller: It's a little bit different when you're raising a cat and a dog, so it's a lot of fun to be raising a dog and a cat like this. When I want to pet a dog, it's nice, and when I want to be a little bit like this, I'm with a cat, and then I'm like, well, if you're a dog, then the dog will have a separate urinary pad, and the cat will have the cat's sanding pad, and that's how it is, so if you think about a kitten, I think about a dog, I mean, it doesn't smell like shit, but the cat does, and it smells really bad, so I've been raising cats at home, and I've seen them for a few days, and I saw them sleeping at dawn, and I slept near a verandah, and I mean, I was sleeping on a TV, and I woke up in the morning and the cat was crying, and the smell was really spreading around the room, so I don't know what it smelled like, but when the cat came in,\nreceiver: I mean, the smell of that animal, you get used to it, you don't know much about us, and the smell of the inside of the house and stuff like that, and I'm like, \"Oh, yeah, you know, I like that stuff, like artificial candles and stuff, because I like to keep the house clean, and the rest of it is just, like, the dog peeing like this.\ncaller: I've never had a dog or a cat for very long, and I never thought about it that way, but dogs and cats actually cost a lot of money, and if they're sick, it's a lot more money to go to the hospital, so I guess it's easier to think of small animals, so this is a little bit like when I was a kid, we'd have a hamster or something like that, but when you don't really know what a hamster is, you know, there's this thing where you're in front of an elementary school, and you're giving them 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and they're selling them in different colors.\nreceiver: When I was a kid, I used to buy a lot of stuff that my brother sold in front of the school, and I've raised it many times, but then I had to buy it again and again because they die so quickly, and then I just bought it because it's so pretty, and then my friend who lives next door almost raised it until it became a chicken, and I saw it with my own eyes.\ncaller: I don't really have much of an interest in anything other than cats, but I have a few friends who have parrots, and I have a couple of friends who have reindeer, and these reindeer are a little bit stressed, a little bit too much, and it's a little bit easier for them to get sick a little bit sooner than I thought, but they're a little bit more aggressive than I thought they would be, and they've got a lot of character, and I think it's going to be a little bit harder than I thought it would be, but I think they're just a little more vulnerable to stress.\nreceiver: I've seen poodles before, and they have to be brushed a little bit, and this is their tail, and they're supposed to be groomed, but I've put a little bit of hair on their ears like this, and then I've brushed them a little bit and I've neglected the brushing, so here's the part where the tail is at the end of the tail, the tip of the ear, and the skin has gotten a little bit weird, so I've got a little tail that's not operated on once, but it's been treated, and it's bandaged in the ear like this, so now I'm wearing it on my neck for about a month, and besides the tail and stuff, and the dogs have skin diseases and stuff, so it's pretty healthy without any big problems, but the other dogs haven't been sick very much, and they haven't had any major surgery, and then they've had an ear transplant, and I don't think they've ever been sick like that, except for one time, and then, you know, they\ncaller: Yeah, you go to a real clinic once, and it costs more than $100,000 to see a real doctor, so you have to live like a real dog, so if a dog is sick, it's a little bit difficult, so I want to keep a little cat, but I don't think I can keep a cat, because it's expensive, but it's very difficult to keep a cat.\nreceiver: No, my dog doesn't have much appetite, and since childhood, he never gives me human food, so I did this. When he eats, I think he just sits on his knees like this next to the food or just trying to eat it. That's a little bit of an artificial habit, I think. It looks like it's just, well, kids who eat this much later grow up with artificial age and get a lot of skin diseases and suffer badly like this.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Can I help you?\ncaller: I'm confused about my card, and I want to use the mileage, but please let me know how many points I have, because I've used my card to collect my mileage, and it's confusing because I don't remember.\nreceiver: You have been confirmed.\ncaller: I'm going to get more, and I'm sure you've got your name and card number right.\ncaller: (1234) / ((day two three) again (5678) / ((o six seven arms) again (9012) / ((ball day two) again (3456) / ((three four six) and it's a better plus credit card. There are a few other cards besides this one, so let's check this one first.\nreceiver: This card is [50000 points] over [0000 points].\ncaller: A few days ago, I was in a luxury restaurant for a few days, and I paid with this card, and I won a national tour event, and I traveled, and I spent so much, and I only got 50,000 points, don't you understand?\ncaller: I've used it a lot, and I know that the more I use it in the terms and conditions, the more points I get, and I don't understand why this is happening.\nreceiver: I'm going to take you to 50,000 points/8,000 points.\ncaller: How much did you spend? 50,000 points to 80,000 points?\ncaller: A: I have a different carbon credit card, and I think I'm saying this by adding it to the same credit card.\nreceiver: Please confirm your card number.\ncaller: It's going to be 1234 again, and then it'll be 444 again, and it will be 555 again, and so on.\nreceiver: So this is going to be 40000 points over 40000 points.\ncaller: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I had all the points on one card, but I wrote a bunch of these cards together, and then I added up all the sharing cards to get the points, and I'm confused because I'm getting older and my memory is getting worse.\ncaller: So what about the mileage period? (1 year) / (one year) or (2 years) / (this year)? Well, I think I've seen it in the Terms and Conditions.\ncaller: You see the terms of use, and you know that you can use it in a bookstore, a movie theater, a restaurant, a hotel, etc., but why can't you use it on an airplane? It's good to be able to use it with airline mileage, and if you can, can you do that too?\ncaller: Ordinary transportation is the subway, the KTX, the SRT, why not the airline?\ncaller: If you have a lot of mileage, it's going to save you money and make it more convenient when you're traveling, so why don't you negotiate with the airline and make the plane available to you?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I asked you before, you said you'd take care of this too, so why don't you always do that? If you want to help your customer's convenience, you have to check these suggestions properly and then reflect on them.\ncaller: When is it going to be reflected? Is it still being negotiated? Is it going to happen in the middle of the year? Well, you have to reflect on these things, and you have to think about them, and you've got to use them, and then you have to write cards around them.\nreceiver: I'll pass it on to the person in charge.\ncaller: If you don't use it by the deadline, you can use it for the next month. If it disappears immediately, it will be remembered and used for another month.\ncaller: And if you can keep using the expiration number next year or next month, and the customer remembers that they didn't use it, and it's linked to a card payment, you want to keep using this card, right?\ncaller: And that's good, because the next time you're going to use it, you'll be able to keep it on schedule, and you won't have to make impulse purchases, so you don't need to spend unnecessarily, and you can help your family, and I think that's where the sharing card is really superior to other card providers.\ncaller: So the Trump card expired, and for whatever reason, they wouldn't let me use it again, and I really didn't want to use it.\nreceiver: Any unused points can be used later.\ncaller: And the sharing card,\ncaller: I wonder if I can use it if my family or friends give me a mileage allowance? I don't usually want to use it or I have trouble renting it around, but it's not in the terms and conditions, so I'll ask the counselor (I'll close) / (I'm going to close).\nreceiver: Both are possible.\ncaller: Is it really possible? W/sharing cards are flexible enough to handle this kind of thing. Usually, you ask a lot of questions when you're getting your mileage from someone else.\ncaller: For some reason, I've been asking a lot of questions about when and where and how to use a certain point, and there's a lot of verification procedures, and I get really annoyed when I have to ask this and that in the store when I'm paying, but I'm really glad that you're letting me use this right away.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: So you can use my card or someone else's card together?\ncaller: If I have multiple cards in my name, I can overlap the mileage with the (1) / (a) card, and someone else has the mileage of the sharing card, and I have legitimate permission to use my card's mileage in conjunction with my card, and of course, I can accumulate the mileage.\ncaller: But there were some places where the use market was in every branch and some places where it wasn't. Why is that? The card company should be able to use it in all the stores.\ncaller: He really liked his coffee, and he wanted to order a bigger one and give it to her as a gift, and then he had to go to the Trump Hotel and pay for it, and there was a mileage limit, and he couldn't use it all, which was really uncomfortable.\nreceiver: It varies from store to store.\ncaller: So, as much as possible, if the stores are the same, we have to make everything available at every location, wherever it is, and if it's not, there are a lot of problems with fairness and access. Sometimes when you pay for drive-thru, the kiosk doesn't work, and the sharing card takes a long time to load, and that's a shame.\ncaller: But it's nice to see a little bit of progress from the customer's point of view.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: But if you could send me a monthly mileage estimate via text message, email, or chat like SNS/SNS, would that be helpful? I think it's discriminatory who comes and who doesn't, even if you have marketing consent.\ncaller: I'm sorry about that, too. I'm also sorry about that. I'll send you a letter of introduction. Please do it now.\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: I'd like you to text me on the 15th of every month, or send me an e-mail.\ncaller: The message may be mistakenly dealt with as spam, so please send the mail for the Sharing Card exclusive to 123@.com.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: I've been asking a lot of questions, and I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm always using a sharing card, and I think my mom is making noise because she's missing stuff, so please refer me to the person in charge of that, and help me make it less awkward.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: If you have any further questions about mileage, I'll get back to you.\nreceiver: Thank you. Do you have any other questions?\ncaller: No, I don't. I'll call you next time I have a question.\nreceiver: Thank you.

Can I pay back as much as I can afford? Or can I only do this within a certain range? And if I make a change, do I have to pay back that amount every month, or can I pay it back whenever I can?\ncaller: I'm looking at you.\nreceiver: Are you calculating that right now? It takes a long time to go to our bank and get a consultation, because if you could do this in the customer center, you wouldn't have to go to the bank and pay half the price and go to the company, which is much better, because you can get this consultation over the phone.\ncaller: We don't know exactly.\nreceiver: Let's see what doesn't count.\ncaller: The maximum amount that can be refunded is 117,000 won.\nreceiver: Are you saying that I can continue to refund the amount of 117,000 yuan / ((one hundred + seventy + one hundred and seventeen million yuan) or tell me if it's only this month, then + and every year + contact the customer center and I + change the refund according to the results of this query?\ncaller: You can't change it in six months.\nreceiver: So what happens when the interest rate goes down again? It's not just going down, it's going up, so maybe it's better to go up.\ncaller: Yeah, it's hard to keep changing it.\nreceiver: A. What do you do?\ncaller: If you're having difficulty, can I end the session?\nreceiver: No, just think about it for a second. (Look) / (Look). I've been waiting for this to connect for almost an hour, and it's connected. It's a good thing I'm not going to the bank.\ncaller: How much is the refund?\nreceiver: You said that the maximum amount is 117,000 yuan per hundred and seventeen million won? So you can't change it for six months? So if you pay 17,000 yuan per hundred seventy million won more, you have to pay about 200,000 yuan per year more, but that doesn't affect the principal amount much because you're paying interest anyway.\ncaller: If you need more time, can we do this another time?\nreceiver: No, just change it that way, just that amount.\nreceiver: Yes, I see. Ask your husband in Katoch.\nreceiver: And you can change the story, and you can tell me why you changed it, because it's a war to live every day, and every day is really varied, and my husband doesn't have an answer.\ncaller: If you can't decide what to talk about, please come back later.\nreceiver: Do you get a penalty if the time is too long? Wait a minute. Oh, I got a call. Just be careful. Every time it's like this + this + this, and then if there's a problem later, you'll tell me what to do.

I think we have a lot of negative emotions because of Japan's long-term domination of our country. Recently, there's been a white list that excludes our country from the white list, which means restricting the import of semiconductors, and I think this has caused a lot of uncomfortable emotions in our country for our people.\ncaller: I think that Japan, by regulating the export of semiconductor products in our country, has done a tremendous job of making us more sensitive to these negative emotions, and as a result, we've heard that our citizens are using the No Japan campaign to make sure that we don't buy Japanese goods, that we don 't travel to Japan, and so on, and this makes the negative emotions in our country worse and worse.\nreceiver: I think it's not traveling, and I've heard that the percentage of Japanese tourists who travel from our country is very high, and that's a huge problem for Japan's revenue as well, because our country doesn't travel in our country, and we have heard that the tourism industry loses a lot of money because we don't get tourists, and we feel a lot of discomfort in our country about not being able to travel to Japan, which is of course the closest country to work, but people are feeling more discomfort, and I think this trend of not traveling to Japan will continue in the future.\ncaller: I'm sure our country has a great deal of sympathy for this issue because of the recent events in Japan, such as the Japanese government's decision to demolish the consolation statue installed in Japan. This security issue arose when Japan ruled our country during the Japanese Occupation, and despite the fact that an international court has been opened between Japan and our country on this security issue, it seems that Japan has not resolved this security issue at all, and has not even apologized properly.\nreceiver: And I think it's very brazen, because even though they did something wrong, they still don't have a proper apology, and they know that Japan has a very high status in the country, so they think they have enough power to control the broadcast or control the citizens, so they know that freedom of the press has very little freedom of the media, and the subjective awareness of the citizens is very low, so they use the media to instill the wrong ideas in the citizens, and I think that if you grow up with such information from a young age, then you can be old enough to instill negative emotions.\ncaller: A few months ago, I saw interviews with Japanese people by our Korean reporters, and one of them was an interview where we asked them if they knew about some of the evil things that Japan had done during its occupation of our country, but what was shocking was that some of the Japanese citizens thought that there were no such acts against our country, and even though they knew, they didn't know at all, so they answered in a format that these Korean-related interviewees could dig up, and the Japanese people said that when they were first taught in school about committing these crimes against our country it wasn't in their curricula, and they weren't mentioned in their education at the beginning. For example, in the case of Germany, these crimes were known to German citizens, and as a result of the responsibility of these German citizens, the Germans have been apologizing for this until now, but the fact is that Japan has no intention of taking any responsibility for this and doesn't want to inform its citizens about this, and I really want to know how to change the Japanese citizen's consciousness about this, if we want to change the way Japanese citizens think.\nreceiver: I think that the most important thing is for the state to come out and change the public consciousness, but Japan has not shown any intention to do so, so I think it's more important for them to have a public consciousness of their own, because Japan doesn't acknowledge their own mistakes, but rather they have said that they should be grateful that our military occupation was a stepping stone for Korea to become a developed country, which means that Japan has no intention of regretting its mistakes and no intention of apologizing.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

How can I help you?\ncaller: Hi, I'm calling to inquire about pre-tax loans, and there are so many types of loans, starting with steeple loans, that I don't know what kind of loans I can take.\nreceiver: If you have any questions, I'll be happy to talk to you.\ncaller: So if we look at the thumbnail loans, this is supposed to be the couple's annual income, but does that include the existing loans? We have other loans.\nreceiver: It doesn't count.\ncaller: A/ Thank you. So income doesn't necessarily mean earned income, does it? You're talking about current plus possible plus possible current income. So can you get a pre-tax loan with existing loans?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: We're newlyweds, and we've been told that even a threshold loan is equivalent to a newlywed's annual income, is that true?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Could it be that if you earn more than that, you don't qualify for a stepping stone loan?\nreceiver: Yes, the eligibility criteria are stated, and if you don't meet them, the stepping stone is invalid.\ncaller: Yeah, so in our case, we can't have a threshold loan, can we just have a general line of credit?\nreceiver: Yes, it is possible.\ncaller: What's the interest rate? Is it possible to know exactly what the interest rate is in today's currency?\nreceiver: We have to look at it.\ncaller: Do banks have different eligibility requirements, interest rates, and so on?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So you don't know what's available at every bank just by looking at it.\ncaller: So what can we learn from a phone call, are there any rough terms or guidelines, and is the sequence of pre-tax loans available after you've identified the house?\nreceiver: Yes, you can apply after you've checked out the house.\ncaller: So I've heard that when I look at [200,000,000]/[200 million]/[80 million] it's up to 80%/[80 percent] pro, but could it be smaller than this?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: We're going to have to move quickly, and I want to know how long the trial is going to take, because if it's too long, we might not be able to schedule it.\nreceiver: You can imagine that.\ncaller: Do you repay the principal with interest in the middle, or do you pay the principal later?\nreceiver: It's two years plus two years minus one year.\ncaller: What if we extend the lease on a pre-owned house? If we only have to pay it back for two years, we won't be able to extend it. If we don't have a big credit problem, can we extend it?\nreceiver: Yes, it does.\ncaller: The other banks that I've looked at, if they extend their term, they have a 10% rebate, is that the case here?\nreceiver: There's no such condition.\ncaller: Could it be that your credit rating is so bad that you can't renew it?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: If you get a pre-tax loan, whose account does it go to? Is it the borrower's account?\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: Are you the owner's manager?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: When you renew your contract after two years, is there any chance that the interest rate will go up?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Uh, yeah, that's kind of unpredictable right now, but are there any documents you need to get a loan, like universal prescriptions, ID cards, money orders?\nreceiver: Yes, we need a copy.\ncaller: Is it possible for my husband to take over the global pharmaceutical business and get a loan in my name?\nreceiver: It's not possible.\ncaller: Is it possible for us to set the interest payment date, or does the bank do it?\nreceiver: You can choose.\ncaller: Is it possible to have a pre-tax loan even if you're not a commercial bank, or do you have to be a commercial bank?\nreceiver: It doesn't matter.\ncaller: A: Thank you so much for your kind advice and your response, which was not very informative and not very accurate, but it helped me a lot in deciding on a loan, thank you again.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you for your help.\ncaller: Thank you.

It was used from June to July last year, and if you're a regular account holder, you can't really confirm that, because it was used between June and July.\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: You don't know, but let me tell you a little bit about this case, which is called the Kim Min-soo case, where Kim Min-su operated an illegal gambling site and a swapping organization in the Philippines, and I've heard that the operation of the system is called a \"big box\", which is a wallet used to move illicit funds, and because of the need for these wallets, a large number of people were given permission to buy wallets.\nreceiver: I've never done anything like that.\ncaller: So if you handed out or sold these warrants, of course you're a perpetrator and you should be investigated, but you said you didn't know anything about this party, and you never created the warrant itself, and now there are over 300 victims, and there are about 200 people claiming to be victims, and it's getting close to 200, and now there's about 120 people in the process of being investigated who are not victimized but are making false statements, because there were so many people responding with false statements that, to put it simply, we feared legal liability, and we re-testified, and I think that if this part happens, we're going to have to do a victim investigation.\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: I'll start the recording now and continue the investigation. Once again, I'd like to introduce you to Detective 5 of the Seoul South District Prosecutor's Office, who is in charge of the financial investigation.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Did you know that Kim Min-soo, a 38-year-old man, opened a new bank account on June 12, 2014 in Mun-la-dong, Seoul?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Did you know that it's being used illegally in the Kim Jong-un case?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: You said that you use a shiny bank, and you're saying that you don't know that there's an account out there that you didn't know about, even though you do a lot of checking?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So you're saying that even though you're doing a lot of checking now, you had no idea that there was an unknown account?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Okay, so the next thing these officers are going to do is, as I mentioned earlier, they're going to freeze the illegal accounts of Shinhan Bank, and you know what that means, freeze the illegitimate accounts of the GCC.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: So in a way, it's an illegal account, so we've made it impossible to even look at the account, but instead, if you're this person in this section, there's a very high probability that another account will come up that's directly connected to financial loss.\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: If you have a small payment, if you have an automatic withdrawal of cash, if you've got a loan in your name, or if you have a non-conforming loan, just tell us what you remember, because we're going to investigate it all.\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: OK, I'll try to link this to the Cyber Investigation Unit, but how do you know if you're using any other banks besides the Bank of China?\nreceiver: We're using the South China Sea, the Sahel, like this.\ncaller: If it's found in any bank other than the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Agricultural Cooperation, can we shut it down?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: How many accounts do you have in a bank, for example?\nreceiver: It's one, and I'm using it for my income.\ncaller: If you say that you have a contract, or an account withholding tax, or a contract that has been terminated, if this happens, we're going to go into freeze immediately, okay?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'll also ask you about the balance of the account you mentioned. For example, if you say that you have 500,000 yuan in the deposit account of the Bank of South Korea, but if instead of 500,000 yuan, 50 million yuan and 100 million yuan are found, you don't know anything about the monetary part? I'll tell you, for example, because these parties can continue to be used as illegal funds. I said that approximately in the case of South Korea how much balance will there be in the amount of deposit account?\nreceiver: It's about 20 million.\ncaller: How much balance does the CAR have in its checking account?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: You don't know the approximate amount? Do you know how much you owe? It's a few million yen or less. This is the amount that you don't have to know. In cases like this, I usually check this amount and then you hand over the information. To get into the investigation, you have to put me in touch with the prosecutor in charge of your case. Whether it's true that you're a victim of fraud or not, there's no separation, and you have to go through a number of parts, whether it's the victim reporting process or the victim verification process, and I'll make sure that you have a separate legal briefing.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you could just give me a rough idea of what that is, and I'll put you in touch with them and help you as you go through the investigation, how much do you know about the bidding process, because you've heard that these parties are laundering money?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: Do you want me to call you, or should I call you back with the office number?\ncaller: Give me the number of the office.\nreceiver: Yes, I understand. Let me help you with that. I'll give you one of my numbers. 321 9420-02 on the Internet portal of the Southern District Attorney's Office. You can dial this number.

Before I joined the military, or while I was in college, I worked non-stop at gas stations, and then I did model house promotional work, and there's a rental company that rents these things for events, seminars, furniture, chairs, refrigerators, and so on.\ncaller: I didn't actually teach a lot of students because I had done an internship in college, but the most memorable student I had was a Korean brother and sister who were about the age of a high school student, and they were a boy and a girl, and they weren't forced by their parents to do internships, and I'm sorry for the internship, but because of their parents' compulsion, those students were given overtime by me, and they hated doing overtime so much that they didn't do their homework well, and they tried to hide in their rooms and not come out when it was time for me to come in, and this experience made them uncomfortable a few times, but soon they came out and played around and talked and played and did overtime again.\nreceiver: There are a lot of jobs in Korea that I would recommend, and I don't know if that's why the Korean work culture is so developed, but there's a lot of different kinds of jobs, and if you look for them, there's lots of honey bees.\ncaller: In the Philippines, where there are a lot of Korean students, there are more jobs than you think you can do as a Korean. Interpreting is basic, and when Korean people visit, you can be a hostess or a tour guide. You seem to prefer outdoor activities, but later you can go abroad to study languages and if possible, I recommend a tourist guide.\nreceiver: If I think about what I should avoid when I work, I think that I can be physically hard, but if I'm mentally hard, it's hard for me to keep working, so once I go to work, and then my colleagues from ALBA, Lynn, are you okay with me, I think this is the first thing that I think about, and if my coworkers aren't okay with it, I don't think I'll be able to enjoy it for long.\ncaller: Actually, I like to try new things, so there's a lot of things that I want to do, and the recording work that we're doing right now is fine, and actually, if I hadn't dropped out of graduate school, I had a dream that I wanted to do something with my voice, whether it's voice work or voice work or narration work, and I would like to try a voice work, which is one of the most dangerous jobs that you can do in Korea, and if you know a job that you shouldn't do, please tell me.\nreceiver: The type of work that you shouldn't do in Korea is low-paying and dangerous work. Usually it's hard and dangerous work, even if you pay a lot of money, the legitimacy is somewhat established, the boss is a little nasty, or the welfare is not good, but the work is often stealing.\ncaller: After finishing my studies, I graduated, came to Korea, and worked in one or two jobs before I started my working life. I also worked in restaurants, but mostly in the service field, because I dreamed of working in the service industry. I worked in restaurants serving food, taking reservations at the information desk, receiving inquiries, etc. It was fun, and it was always new and convenient because it was my first time seeing it. Do you have any websites or applications that I could recommend for finding a job in Korea?\nreceiver: I usually use a bunch of different apps when I'm looking for alpacas -- there's an app called Alpaca Paradise, there's Alpamon, and there's Jell-O, but the best site for finding alpacas in Jersey City is the Jersey City University Life Board, which is the most well-known to the people of Jersey City, and that's where I usually look for alpaca, so I recommend the Jersey City Life Board when you're looking for alpas in Jersey City.\ncaller: I've been talking to you, and I think you're a resident of Imperial City, so if you know of any Arby's on Imperial City that are different from those on the mainland, please let me know.\nreceiver: If you're talking about the odd jobs that can only be done on the mainland, then I think Al Arba'it is a strange job that can't be done on land because the mainland is a tourist destination.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

And then what I personally think of as health supplements are fruits and vegetables, so I'm going to work really hard on it, whether you're cooking it or eating it organically, and when you're having three meals a day, you should be thinking about your diet and making it.\ncaller: I can't eat all three meals in a day, because I've been waking up late, and I usually eat two meals a day, lunch and dinner, and I don't really think that I'm in the habit of eating all these nutritious things at lunch and dinner. I guess the people I live with aren't even my family, and now I live with a friend, and you know, it's kind of hard to expect that kind of nutritious diet, so sometimes, except when I'm eating out, I'm actually eating a little bit of instant food or something like that at home.\nreceiver: I used to think about my diet for, like, a week, but now I don't think about it that much, but I think about what I'm going to eat for the day, first of all in my head, and then one day, I'm trying to figure out what kind of diet I can eat, which is something that I can eat a little bit more abundantly and a little more leisurely, and then when I'm on a diet, I have a little bit of leisure to sit down for an hour and try to eat in a way that I can do, and then while I'm eating, I think about all the things that I have to do, and I'm thinking about plans for next year, and trying to plan for an hour or so of leisurely eating.\ncaller: Oh, I've been wanting to try a diet for a while now, and one of the diet plans that came up was intermittent fasting, which I haven't tried in a long time, and this is what I've heard, and I think I've seen a couple of articles where they say that it's actually better for your health to go on a diet for one day and then the next day, but actually, starving yourself for one day is really hard for people who work, because it's a little distracting for them during the day, so I had some knowledge.\nreceiver: Fortunately, I don't have any major illnesses, so I'm healthy, but I have a lot of hangovers, and I'm a little bit careful about those illnesses, and the one I'm most prone to getting is a cold these days, and because of the coronavirus, the hygiene is so strict, I still feel like I'm going through a little bit of a cold, but I'm in a bit of a high-altitude area these days, so there's a big difference in temperature between morning and evening, so that's why I'm taking care of that part, because you were talking about intermittent fasting a little while ago, and as far as I know, I'm not starving for a day, but I know that eight hours out of the 24 hours, I eat as much as I want, and the rest of the time I wear a uniform, if you're not wrong.\ncaller: I'm not sure if I'm reading this right, but from what I've heard, you've been starving for a little more than 24 hours a day, and since then you've gone on, and for eight hours you've eaten as much as you want, and I don't know.\nreceiver: I don't feel like it's a particular side effect, but I know a lot of things, like Tylenol, and it works in a lot of places, but in cases like mine, I often feel like it counts a little bit, so I sleep a little bit more, or I have a little bit of weakness in some places, and if it's an emergency, if it doesn't really hurt, I tend to avoid taking the medication a little bit.\ncaller: In fact, in my case, I'm pretty healthy, and I've never been hospitalized, so I don't do a lot of lying down or anything like that, but I do get a lot of headaches, like a cold or something, and sometimes I get a little headache because of my job, so I think I'm almost healthy and doing well, except maybe once or twice a month. What do you think about home training?\nreceiver: I think one of the most important things for modern people today is time, so I think it's a great way to do what I can do in the time I can save, and the most important thing in exercise is posture, but I've been told that when I look at home training, I have to take the proper posture to fit it, and I think there are times when I take the wrong posture and I feel like I'm doing the right exercise, and if I pay attention to that part, I think that home training can also have a good effect even if I don't go to the gym directly.\ncaller: In my case, it's probably a little bit of a tool or a device called a device, rather than an exercise with a device, I'm looking for a little bit more of an exercise that I can do with my bare body, for example, if it's a flank, now it's called a core exercise, yes, on the floor, now in a lying position for a few seconds, which is good, and something like that, or if there's something like leg strength, there's also something called squats that builds a lot of leg strength, uh, or something like home workouts, jump lines that you can do in front of your house even if you don't have a home workout, and I think it's okay. Well, in fact, there are many exercises that can be done at home without a device, and in fact, they're a little bit boring or difficult to do, if you've ever been to an academy like Jon Pilates or a health diet.\nreceiver: In fact, I had some physical therapy time last year because of an accident, and I was recommended by your physical therapist to do yoga and Pilates, but he said, \"Well, it's not too much trouble, so you might want to take it slow\". So even if it's a simple Pilates machine, or any of the other yoga moves that I've talked about, I've been doing things that can stretch the muscles in my back and legs with simple things like cat poses, and if I ever get the chance, I'd like to see Yoga and Pilates. I'm interested in exercising, so if you have any exercises that you can do without spending money, would you recommend them?\ncaller: I've told you before that the best exercise you can do without spending any money is actually bare-knuckle exercise, and the best thing about it is that it's the best exercise that you can do with your friends, and it's fun, and you can do it for a long time, and if you can only do it with your bare knuckles, it's like the flank or squat, or you can bend your arms, stretch your legs, and lift your upper body like this, and in the case of the upper body lift, I do a little bit of a jiggle, because there's a lot of mass going on in your back, and that's what you do, and then you find some alternative exercise, and you do a lot of this and then you rest, and I recommend that you do lots of leg exercises, or Martin Clymer, or some other kind of core exercise, if you don't have a lot of diet friends around.\nreceiver: I don't know if I can tell you that dieting is the most important thing to women, but I also know that I'm not as obsessive about dieting as I used to be, and I'm free to eat what I want, and then I'm able to manage the rest of it by exercising, so I guess I have no friends who are so obsessed with dieting or dieting that they're thirsty, and I just wish that I wasn't being properly squeezed into eating and drinking when I'm taking care of my health.\ncaller: In fact, in my case, as I've said before, I take vitamin B and C and so on, and in the case of medication, it doesn't seem to have any effect as soon as I take it, and then the next day, suddenly, I'm a little bit tired, and I don't really get sick or anything like that, and then I forget what the name of the effect is, but there are things that I think about, and I think that by taking this medication, I'll be a little bit less tired the next day.\nreceiver: I'm not a big fan of taking health supplements, so normally I take what's around me and think, this is a health supplement, and I eat a lot of things, and one of them is water, and I'm trying to take in a lot of water, because it's very dehydrated again this summer, and I think there's an immediate reaction, because there's a lot of metabolic processes that go on with water, and of course there's the difficulty of having to go to the bathroom a lot because of the side effects, but it's the part where the water is the most accessible, and it's doing this kind of thing as my health supplement, but I have a personal thought, and we think protein is important for our health these days, so I'm going to eat protein once a week.\ncaller: In fact, when it comes to proteins, you have to eat protein, and the protein you're eating is probably meat, because I've been living with a friend for a while, and in fact, the protein that tastes like protein is actually meat, so you're going to eat a lot of meat, but in fact, there are a lot more cases where you're lacking other nutrients than protein, so in fact, you're almost overeating protein.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Because I don't really know what card I have.\nreceiver: Do you go shopping often?\ncaller: I like your shopping, and I do it a lot, and I buy a lot online at places like (A) / (E) Market or (33rd Street) / (Thirty Third Street).\nreceiver: So I think it's a good idea to have an A/E card with a five percent discount on basic necessities.\ncaller: If it's an essential part of your life, does it include the (A) / (E) market or (33rd Street) / (Thirty Third Street) that I mentioned?\nreceiver: Including you.

How much discount do you get online?\nreceiver: You can get a 5% discount if you pay more than 30,000 won.\ncaller: Is it possible to use it abroad? I travel abroad sometimes, so I need a card that can be used abroad.\nreceiver: (A) / (E) cards are allowed.\ncaller: So is there an airline discount?\nreceiver: Yes, we can do that.\ncaller: And then I want to do it with an A over an E card.\nreceiver: Can I help you with the cards?\ncaller: Yes, I'd like to see your A/E card.

I'm not home during the day, so it's probably going to be hard to pick up when I get home, but would it be okay if my family had a replacement?\nreceiver: I need your ID.\ncaller: Yeah, I was wondering if you could use the card right away, or do you need to register it separately? It's usually available right after it's issued.\nreceiver: If you want to receive a proxy, you have to register it yourself.\ncaller: A: If you receive it yourself, you can use it without registration, and then we'll take it to the company.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. This is Seoul City, Seoul District, Seoul Avenue. And what is the credit card limit? Can I set the limit?\ncaller: If the limit is adjustable, I'd like to ask for $30,000, because I think it's difficult to manage if the limit is too high.\ncaller: And I'd like to make the deadline the first of the month, if that's possible.\ncaller: Thank you.\ncaller: No further questions.

You know, I've done a lot of work for you, and I've been doing a lot for people who have credit reports, and I suddenly heard about it, and I don' t know what to say, and I thought, \"Oh, this is ridiculous.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: So I knew I shouldn't.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, what do you need? What do you need a budget for?\ncaller: Wait a minute, I'm going to check the deposit now.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: The client's current account balance is $382,500.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So this is your three-month warranty cost, the government's cost of guaranteeing you, so you take out a loan for three months and you don't renew it for three months, and then at the fourth month, you automatically receive 380,000 won from the receipt of the loan, from 382,560 won, if you renew it once in three months, so 382,570 won is the money that you don' t get and it' s automatically gone, you know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So in a nutshell, the government -- in other words, the government is going to increase the credit of your customers, but because there are so many people, they're also going to increase their credit, and that's what's going to produce these loans on this scale.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you understand?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, I'm telling you over the phone that I have an incentive for you to take out a loan because of me.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Your client is making progress.\nreceiver: Where is it?\ncaller: We are OK Savings Bank's appraisal department.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You mean that address?\nreceiver: No, not at all.\ncaller: It's a sacred site over there in the Gangnam district of Samsun-dong.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: And then,\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: Well, I'd like to see a little more of that.\ncaller: But I'll be honest with you, and I'll tell you the truth, the higher the limit, the more incentive I get. When I first call, there are people who ask me to do it, because I see the review, so I'll ask them to do it a little bit higher. Honestly, that's why I've been so honest with myself, because I've let people who came in with 5 million won get up to 15 million won. Now, because you've received a bad review from me, if you want me to give you an honest review, I can raise it again. And honestly, I can do that, but if you do, you'll have to get a review again. It's not just because of me, it's because of my team and all the team members who are there. I know how to get attention for a few months now, and then you call me again and you give me a new review, and I just have to raise my customer rating.\nSo you call me back and you have to raise the threshold as if you're a new client when you're interviewed.\nreceiver: So if you just get it for what you're seeing now, when can you get it?\ncaller: Today, today, we're going to go to your client's credit union, and we'll make a payment, and then you'll be a voter's representative, and you'll call right away, and that's it.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: That's right.

We have our own internal number.\nreceiver: I don't know what you're talking about.\ncaller: Hi. How are you?\nreceiver: Hi. How are you?\ncaller: Well, first of all, there's the part where you can record it, and then we can do a little bit of research, and then there's this part where we can judge whether it's true or not.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, in order to determine whether Mr. Usancheon is a direct participant in this incident or a victim of a leak, I'm going to conduct a preliminary investigation on tape.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm going to record all of these conversations, and they're going to be used as evidence in the investigation.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So I'm going to start the recording now. This is a one-on-one call recording investigation of this case. I'm Detective Inspector Ihokjun from the Seoul District Police Intelligence Crime Investigation Team.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Do you know the perpetrator, Mr. Moga?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Don't you know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is there any evidence that you opened a bank account at the Songpa-gu Songpa-dong branch in Seoul around 2:30 p.m. on March 4, 2015?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: So is there any truth to the fact that you opened an account with the People's Bank of China on March 3, 2015 at around 1:40 p.m. at the Yansemond branch in Seoul's Gangnam District?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: So, did you ever sell or give away your wallet to anyone else?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: Are you dealing with the People's Bank of China and the Bank of Agriculture?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: What other banks do you deal with?\nreceiver: It's a new bank.\ncaller: Are you using a shiny bank?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Have you lost your citizenship or driver's license in the last year?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: You've never been missing. Is it true that everything you've said so far is not a lie?\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: Now, now, turn off the recording and I'll explain.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: How are you?\nreceiver: Let's hear it.\ncaller: Once again, this is a large-scale incident, with dozens of victims and billions of dollars in damages.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, Mr. Yong Sanchoun, as you claim, you don't know anything and you are now part of the victim. If that's true, now that your personal information has been leaked and you're now in the mainstream, criminals can now open another account in your name in another bank and use it for illegal transactions. So the most urgent procedure right now is to trace the account to prove that Ms. Yong Shanchoun is an innocent victim of criminals and conspiracy and prevent further damage from occurring.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And from that point on, we're going to let you help us, and from now on, through an account check, we'll verify that you're the victim of a data breach, as you claim, and through an account search, we will prove your innocence.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And when the account is opened, your account will be blocked for financial transactions.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: Now that you've stopped using your bank account, is there anything uncomfortable about your personal life?\nreceiver: What's that?\ncaller: Financial transactions are now going to stop using cards.\nreceiver: All of it?\ncaller: If you hang up now, why do you do that from now on, because I can't tell you exactly whether you're a victim or an accomplice to what I'm about to tell you, but first of all, I'm going to help you with that part of it.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So in our case right now, like the Depositors Protection Act, if you apply to us, we're going to help you with that, and in our case, the Depositor Protection Act, you're not going to be protected by the financial law if you're under $5 million, and the assets you have are not the assets you're asking us for, so your current assets are now over $5 million.\nreceiver: Is it more than $5 million? Of course it is.\ncaller: Now, about the funds that you have in your possession, please give the financial institution an approximate amount, because there's a part of us that needs to be protected, and we need to give it to our team leader when we make a request to investigate.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: So we're going to check if you're using a new bank right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You've never used anything other than the Shinhan Bank?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you have any savings or anything like that?\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: How much of your current account in your new bank do you have to protect the monetary part of it?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Do you have any idea how much money is in your bank account right now?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You don't know the exact amount. So are you using smart banking or internet banking right now?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, first of all, I'm going to put you in touch with the chief financial officer in a few minutes, and we're going to start an investigation into account tracking, so please cooperate fully with the investigation.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So if you'll just hold on a second, and I'll put you right on the phone, there's something you need to take notes on right now, can you take notes now?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Do you have any notes? Do you have a moment? I'm going to give you the case number right now.\nreceiver: Yeah, but you can't store it.\ncaller: You're not saving now? Are you a cell phone or a smartphone?\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Can't you get into that notebook and make some notes?\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: Yes, please.\ncaller: Yes, the 2015 coup.\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Highs and Lows 2015\ncaller: Yes. I'm going to tell you it's 2377.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This is the case number, and I'm telling you right now that the investigator I'm talking to is Detective Ihojun of the Seoul Police Department's Intelligence Crime Investigation Team, so please don't hang up the phone, just wait a minute.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We've got your call. It's intelligence and interrogation. Have you been assigned a case number by your own investigator?\nreceiver: What's the case number?\ncaller: This is case number 2377 of the 2015 Homicide Squad.\nreceiver: If you could just wait a moment, we'll investigate and report to you directly.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: Mr. Yoon Sang Choon, is that you?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Now, you've been identified for fraud and violation of the Electronic Money Laundering Act in connection with the Mogao employee fraud case, and you've also been linked to a subsequent suspension of payments for account tracking, correct?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We're going to assess and open up your financial records in the course of our investigation to determine whether there was any ill-gotten gains or illicit funds or financial ties with any of the suspects we've identified.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, I want to let you know that we're going to be suspending your entire wallet on Friday, so if you say you have a problem with your life, you can apply for the Deposit Protection Act, and if you implement the Deposits Protection Act, you can use it without any sanctions during our investigation, because it can take from seven days to three months to complete the investigation.\nreceiver: Is the bank that he asked the investigators to file for the Deposit Guarantee Act, Shinhan Bank and National Bank?\ncaller: No, it's one of those banks.\nreceiver: Is it a new bank? How big is the risk of losing your own money?\ncaller: I don't know.\nreceiver: It's estimated that your current net worth on Friday is more than $1 million and less than $2 million.\ncaller: More than one million yuan.\nreceiver: A million won or less than two million won?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: You don't have any experience in trading stocks or bonds?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Okay, wait a minute, are you using Internet banking, mobile banking, telebanking from your bank?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: What do you use most?\ncaller: He uses Internet banking a lot.\nreceiver: Do you only use online banking?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Didn't you get a complaint from your investigator that you were denied 5 million won under the Depository Protection Act?\ncaller: I don't know.\nreceiver: If you do, we'll send you a summons so that you can come in when your time is up.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: Then we'll send you a subpoena to freeze your entire financial system and have it investigated.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}

You're in the workplace now, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, if someone else's flesh comes in besides your own, because it's impossible to investigate, where are you right now, right now, in the workplace?\nreceiver: I'm in the office.\ncaller: Okay, well, first of all, we don't want anyone but our own flesh getting in, so why don't you move to a quieter place?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And bring your headphones, because you'll be checking the incident logs with your smartphone right now, and, yes, bring a pen and a notebook.\nreceiver: Wait, but how long is this going to take?\ncaller: It doesn't take that long, we just need to confirm a few things, and first of all, the case itself isn't a closed case, and there's a lot of data leakage going on these days through co-workers, so you can't share the investigation process or the information that's being investigated with a third party, so I think you have to give me some clues.\nreceiver: What's not possible?\ncaller: So you can't tell your coworkers what you're investigating, because we still have four co-conspirators who haven't been verified.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: What kind of mobile device do you use?\nreceiver: This is Mars right here.\ncaller: Okay, well, put your headphones on first.\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\nreceiver: Hi. How are you?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'm going to go somewhere else.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: I said yes. I'll listen to you now.\ncaller: First of all, have you moved? Please move to a quieter place.\nreceiver: But do I have to ask you something right now?\ncaller: It's not that urgent. I'll tell you why we're investigating right now. You said after 5 p.m., and that's when we're out of the office. And yes, I've called before, but I was absent. If you don't get investigated today, you could get a trial date. If you get a court date, you have to be a lawyer. If you say you're a lawyer, you could be fined. If you're fined, you'll be fined more than three million yen. If you can afford it, look here.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, I'm not going to be able to call you back in five minutes, because it's lunchtime in a little while, and I have to do some research, so I have to tell you, I am not going to eat.\ncaller: Yeah, I need you to make a call.\nreceiver: Yeah, or we could have lunch and talk if we could.\ncaller: No, it's phone status first, and it's recording status first, so if the phone goes down for five minutes or more, we have to start all over again, and we're not the kind of agency that we normally investigate on our own time.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Yes. So first of all, you have to tell your boss that you're being investigated first, so I can hang up on you for a while, but it's not possible to do an investigation after lunch, so first of all can I hang up now?\nreceiver: Yeah, well, I'll call you back in a little bit, and I'll pick it up then.\ncaller: Okay, should I call you back in exactly how many minutes?\nreceiver: I think it's three minutes.\ncaller: Okay, first of all, you can't talk to your boss about the incident, but you can just tell him that you have some urgent business to take care of and that you're going to take your seat for a little while, and I'll do it later after dinner.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}

Southeast Seoul Police Department is known as the Civil Affairs Bureau for Criminal Profit Recovery.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Actually, I'm being contacted by an investigator for sex trafficking and money laundering violations.\nIs it okay if I talk to you for a second?\nreceiver: The sex trade?\ncaller: I'm not saying that you were a sex worker, I'm just saying that your personal information came out during the sex trafficking investigation, and first of all, after I explain the facts of the case, I'll help you find out on the website of our public prosecutor's office where the case involving Mr. Zhang was filed, firsthand.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Since this is not a closed case, there are many sensitive issues, and since the case itself has been declared an embargo case, I would like to ask you to understand that if you leak information about the case, you can be punished with imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to seven million yen.\ncaller: Let me give you a brief description of the incident: Have you ever visited Seoul's Gangnam District between March and June of last year?\nreceiver: No, I don't have one.\ncaller: Then do you know the Eastville Hospital in Gangnam?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Kim Sang-ho has been arrested for sex trafficking and money laundering in a total of seven locations, but what about his relationship with you?\nreceiver: I don't know him.\ncaller: Are you saying there's no connection at all?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I understand, but at the time we searched for the master criminal Kim Sang-ho, there was a situation where Zhang Chang-gu withdrew the proceeds of crime to our bank account. So far, the only amount confirmed by us is 23 million won. Have you ever opened a bank account with us?\nreceiver: I've never opened one.\ncaller: You say you've never opened one, but have you ever loaned it to a third party in your name or lost your ID or driver's license?\nreceiver: No, he didn't.\ncaller: If this section is opened, the prosecutor will be able to accurately judge whether he was pardoned or convicted, and if there is no evidence of Mr. Zhang's involvement in this case, our prosecutor on Friday will help you proceed with the victim identification procedure.\ncaller: Now, I'm going to help you with your first-hand look at the public notice that you're about to receive and the one that was used in the incident. Open your phone, Google it, or open the Chrome Internet window, and type 118.160.89.83 because I'll call you.\nreceiver: I got it.\ncaller: Do you see the website of the DA's office? It looks like it's a case study, and if you click on it and check your name at the bottom, you'll see a case report.\nreceiver: Yeah, I can see that.\ncaller: What's the case number? You can see the location at the bottom, take your social security number, and read it out loud. If you go to the next one, you can see the arrest warrant. Is the place of detention at the bottom the Seoul District?\nreceiver: Yes, I can see that.\ncaller: If you go to the next one, you'll see our bank's transaction log, and this is an important part of it, so make sure that you know who they are, and you've checked and captured them all, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, as I said earlier, if there's any third-party noise mixed in during the recording, it doesn't qualify as forensic evidence.\ncaller: I'm the head of the Department of Criminal Profit Redemption at the South Seoul Police Department. Are you Mr. Jang Jang Gu, born April 12, 1976?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: What is your relationship with Mr. Kim Sang-ho?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Where were you at the end of January 2020?\nreceiver: It was in the same place as it is now.\ncaller: I'd like to know your current residence by name and date.\nreceiver: It's also springtime.\ncaller: Did you use an iPhone at that time in 2020? What kind do you use now?\nreceiver: They use iPhones.\ncaller: If you were economically active at that time in 2020, what about your current job?\nreceiver: I did, and I just go to work.\ncaller: Yes, we've done all the paperwork, and now we're going to be investigated by the Financial Supervisory Authority, which is in the process of merging, for financial transaction requests.

I was going to pay for the game, but I got confused because I didn't get paid.\ncaller: OK, so I'm going to check some information, but can you tell me your current cell phone number and your birthday to verify your identity?\nreceiver: Yes, his phone number is 010-1234-5678, and his birthday is May 15, 2003.\ncaller: Thank you. Your information has been verified. The liquidation service will be activated immediately, and you will be able to liquidate with your mobile phone from now on. Do you have any further questions?\nreceiver: Yes, thank you. Can I charge the game now?\ncaller: Yes, that's right. Now the liquid solution will be processed normally. If you have any other questions, please contact us at any time.\nreceiver: Thank you, Mr. Kim Hyun-soo. You have solved the problem. Have a good day.\ncaller: Yes, Kim Min-joon, have a good day.

You ever get a call like this?\nreceiver: I've had it a few times before, when someone called me \"son\" and asked me to send money for an accident.\ncaller: What did you do?\nreceiver: I was confused for a second, but then I called your dad and he said it was a scam, so I hung up.\ncaller: It's a scary world these days, and adults have to be careful.\nreceiver: That's why it's important to always be suspicious and to check in person, especially when it comes to money or personal matters, never do it over the phone.\ncaller: Yeah, you're right, I'll be more careful in the future.\nreceiver: Yeah, Minzy, and if you get any more weird calls, call the bank or the police.\ncaller: How was your day, Mom?\nreceiver: I was just doing some housework, and I came by to check on things.\ncaller: I was going to school, doing some homework, and then I got this call, and I was so surprised I couldn't do anything.\nreceiver: It's normal to be surprised when you get a call like this, but don't panic, just hang up.\ncaller: Yeah, Mom, I'm going to be really careful.\nreceiver: Yes, Minji, we all have to be careful not to get hurt.\ncaller: Mom, I'm going to finish my homework.\nreceiver: Yes, I'm studying hard, and I love you, Minji.\ncaller: I love you too, Mom.\nreceiver: Yeah, see you later.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 0}

First of all, EXO loves Xiumin. I've loved Xiumin since I was in the sixth grade in elementary school, and I've been loving her for seven years in the sunshine, and Xiumin is always good at taking care of herself, and she's good at reminding people, and I think she's still attractive to me. She's in the army now, but she's coming out in 20 or 10 days, so I'm really interested and I think that Xiumin's voice is really good, especially in the butterfly girl, and I also think that she's really good at rapping.\ncaller: I'm more into actors than idols, especially Kim Soo Hyun and Song Seung Gi, so I also like Kim Su Hyun's Song Seung gi drum kit, so all three of them were subscribed to the fancafe, but since they haven't been active lately, all three have dropped out.\nreceiver: I'm a big fan of Siouxsie, but I'm also a huge fan of the Monster X's, and I've only known them since last year, so I've decided to become a fan. I didn't join the Monster X fan club in Monteverde this year, so next year I'll definitely join it. The Monstera X's are very popular physically and their songs are very popular, especially the song \"Knock Out\" because I think it's a good song even when I'm not interested. I've been looking for a lot of live cams.\ncaller: I found out through an article that Xiumin is now coming back to the society from the army. It's been a while since something happened, but I felt like it was coming soon, but the fans seem to have waited a long time to see it, so I liked Xiumin a little bit as usual, so I'm going to listen to a lot of songs if they come out.\nreceiver: I think I listen to a lot of XO's winter albums, because XO has released a winter album every year, and I remember that I didn't release one last year, but I still remember that I made about four albums, and when it's only winter, I remember that time and I think of each one, and it's a little bit like a perfume. I think it's really nice to listen to an XO winter album, and I feel embraced, and I think I went to a concert in the old days. I like the winter album, but I also think the title album is really good. I think there's a lot of charm in each of the members of the anthems there. If you buy an idol album, there is a CD that you can listen to, and it tastes good, and you feel like you have an idol album. Have you ever bought an idol album?\ncaller: I've never bought an idol album with my own money, and I've gotten one because a friend dumped me, but I don't have to look for it, because I'm not really interested in idols, and I can listen to the songs on Melon or YouTube, and you don't necessarily have to listen to them through the CD on the album, so I'm more in favor of using Melon than CDs, especially because I like the Refund Garden songs that are at the top of the charts these days, and I listen to them every day, and I like the ballads better, but this song is also more affectionate because I've seen the process of how it's created by looking at the senses together.\nreceiver: I don't listen to the charts, I listen to the playlists myself, especially because I really like Idol, and almost 90 percent of the songs are Idol songs. As much as I love Idol, I pick up the Idol Survival program every day, especially No Mercy, and I've seen it before, and the producers were really beggars, so I went back a few times, particularly No Mercy was the show where Monster X debuted, where the trainees in the Starship appeared on a show called Old Mercy and ended up debuting as seven people, and there was a guy named Sher-Noo at the beginning, and I was watching that show, and now that I think about it, I think it's really strange that I liked Sher-Nuo, and then I thought it wasn't really my style, but now that I look at it, it's so cute, and there's this middle-aged singer called Old Mer-Noo, and I remember there's a lot of stuff that was put into the show, and all of a sudden there's really a lot of other middle-aged actors who didn't get\ncaller: I remember seeing this in a news story, and I remember going to a restaurant and getting yelled at because five or six people were eating in a city like this, but when we go to a restaurant, there's a bunch of us, and it's unfortunate that you get yelled at for being a celebrity, and maybe it's wrong in some ways, but it's not usually the case, it's more common than that.\nreceiver: I think it's okay that you're a celebrity and you're setting a higher standard, but I think that's what you're doing, and there's a lot of people who criticize you for that, but I don't think that idols are dating a little bit, but even if idols do date, I'd rather have a secret relationship with them without a tie, and then I think that it's a little bit selfish for them to want their fans to understand that idols eat a little bit of their image, and from that point of view, I think that fans cheat a lot, especially this time Xiao Chen got married, and I think it is not a little bit in this part, I think it isn't polite for the fans who have been supporting and trusting me all along, what do you think?\ncaller: I know that Idol has been banned from dating for two or three years, but I think it's okay for Idol to date, and I don't think it makes a lot of difference if she does it after two years of her contract, because Idol is a person, and we all have to date and we have to get married, and I think that's right, but it's not cheating on the fans.\nreceiver: I think I'm right, when my favorite idol has an affair, at first it's really painful, and when I think about how much she's done, it's a little bit embarrassing to think that I would have done it myself. I usually watch the show, and I really like rap, and I've seen a lot of showgirls and high school rappers, and I was surprised to see a guy named Wonderstein rapping in Showgirls recently, and I found out that he lived in the same area, so I think there was a lot of emotion and I was even more surprised to see him rapping.\ncaller: I don't necessarily watch it, but I've seen a lot of videos on Facebook and Instagram, so I know some of the names of the rappers, and I especially remember the high school rapper who was nominated because he studied rap for six months and ended up winning. Especially these days, when you're on the air, when you put the nomination on, there's like 10,000 people that come and watch the show, and I didn't know why, but once you've seen it, it's so much fun.\nreceiver: I've always missed the timing of a good live show, but I don't think I've been to a lot of celebrity live shows, but I've seen a lot of Idol live shows, like XO's Kairaiden or XO'S Baekhyun, and I've watched a lot of these idols live, and I think I was really impressed with Mark as a rapper in the first two seasons of High Rapper, and I thought he was really impressive because he's a rapper from Encyte, and his job as an idol is to be a rapper, and there's a lot of preconceived notions about him, but Mark worked so hard to get to a very high rank, and I was very impressed by that scene, so I think the interest in Mark has also increased.\ncaller: I've seen more videos of Kim Ha-hoon than I've ever watched, and I like him because he's so pure, and when he raps, he raps so seriously, and it's so cool. I liked him as well as Vincent, and his voice is charming, and that's why I like him. Recently, I heard a rumor on ESPN that he's a cheater, and I don't listen to him anymore.\nreceiver: My favorite rapper is a rapper named Juhan, and this rapper was also in show business, and now he's a MonsterX rapper, and his pronunciation is really accurate, but his rap is also really fast, and he's really cool, and his performances are really good, and I like to listen to him a lot. He's a rapper. I remember a lot of the old shows these days when it's like Sunday, and I remember lots of the old gigs that we used to do on Sunday nights with my family, and a lot of them, and my favorite one was Conner, who's called the Octopus Party, because you can look at him and laugh and forget about going to school tomorrow, and I thought it was great, and what I remember was a corner called Moon, where the main character showed a lot of really vivid shows, and he did a lot of amazing performances that I wanted to be a part of, but I thought he was really great, because he practiced hard for a week, and I don't like to play gigs in front of people, and I think there's a lot of talent in that kind of\ncaller: I used to go to a gag concert on Sundays, and it was really fun, and by the time it was over, I didn't feel like I had to go to school tomorrow, but it was the most fun I ever had, and then it got more fun and more fun, and then the gag concert was canceled, and I'm sorry to say, have you ever seen a gag show or a comedy show?\nreceiver: I've only seen videos on YouTube from time to time, and I think I've done a better job of capturing the momentum of Infinity War than those comedy shows, because Infinity War was a show that we loved for a long time, and it's just so sad that it's suddenly gone, but I felt like there were so many people who were grieving, and I felt like I could just see the clips on YouTube and see how many viewers were waiting for Infinity War, and I thought my favorite rotation was the telephony special where the members had just spread out across Seoul and built a store in the farthest place, and I could feel the friendship between the members, and most of all, it was fun, and it was very moving, and I really liked watching Infinity War a lot.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

How can I help you?\ncaller: Yeah, hi. I was wondering about the house cleaning deposit. Do you have a wired consult?\ncaller: I'm a home equity subscriber, and they said that home equity holders can buy public housing.\ncaller: I know it's a public housing project under construction in Korea, but is this private housing also available for bidding? I need to verify that it's true for what I know.\ncaller: Okay, so I'm wondering if I can change the name of my Housing Benefit to my other family name?\ncaller: It says you can only change your name by death or resurrection, but I'm curious.\nreceiver: It's not possible.\ncaller: I can't do that, because I'm going to have to have an income deduction soon, and I've got a contract savings deduction, and I don't have a home that meets the criteria, but if I do, I want to see if the commodities themselves are deductible.\ncaller: And that's only possible for me, whether I represent my immediate family or not.\ncaller: And then, my mortgage was sold off, so I'm trying to sign up for a new mortgage savings account at CS Bank, but can I sign up online without visiting?\ncaller: Oh, you can do it on the Internet. I'll have to look it up on the website. Do I have to go to the bank for the deposit itself? I want to minimize the hassle of having to go there every time to process the deposit.\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: You mean you can do it through other banks, automated machines, Internet banking?\ncaller: That's very convenient.

Is it the same if you have a new product, but you've used it before?\nreceiver: It's difficult.\ncaller: I don't think I can change the number of payments, sorry, and this doesn't have anything to do with a mortgage deposit, is there any way that I can be the only one who knows about the bank transactions?\ncaller: Oh, it's a safe deposit account, right? I heard that CS Bank has this kind of service, and I thought it was a little different from other banks, so I got interested.\ncaller: Like it says here, if you sign up, you can't see the transaction without my approval or the store manager's approval?\ncaller: So I'm going to have to register a number of wallets in front of me in the safe account registry, so that I can register all the wallets that I use.\ncaller: So after signing up for an account, the process is that I go in and submit my citizenship card, and then the store manager has to verify that I can open an account or make payments, and no one else can see my citizenship cards.\ncaller: I'm guessing you'll have to go to the branch to sign up for a safe account, and you'll need to verify your identity.\ncaller: Well, I'm sure I'd be more comfortable visiting and dealing with it, so we'll just have to sign up online for the mortgage, and we'll have to go slowly to the branches for the savings account.\ncaller: What about the paperwork?\ncaller: You're just going to bring your ID, a copy, or proof of family ties, a certificate of appreciation, of appreciation?\ncaller: What's the deadline for filing?

Sharing bank? Uh/ I was just calling to ask a few questions.\ncaller: I recently bought a refrigerator for my grandmother, and it's the end of the year, and I got a bonus, and I thought it would be good for my mental health in a lot of ways to pay it off a day early rather than blowing off steam, so I called with the idea of paying it off this time.\nreceiver: You did.\ncaller: Yeah, well, you might as well cut him off. I can't shake the idea of being a grandmother.\ncaller: Not so long ago, I had a big fight with my husband right before the end when he said he was going to buy furniture because he didn't want to pay for it.\ncaller: Anyway, this time it's the refrigerator, and I don't want to look like that anymore, so I'm going to pay it off as soon as possible.\nreceiver: Yes, sir, I'd like to briefly confirm your name and credit card number.\nreceiver: You don't have to tell me your card number.\ncaller: A: Yes, and then like this.

It's not about how you do your paperwork, it's about why you do it.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: So let me tell you about a case that's being handled by our bank.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: You'll be contacted by an attorney from a law firm that has a trust agreement with our bank.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: And then all the conversations between you and your attorney would be transcribed into a phone recording, just like we're doing now, and based on that recording, your attorneys would be able to certify the recording.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Listen carefully to the questions your attorney will ask you in a particular case of probate over the phone, and if you answer yes, yes, and no, no, correctly, the probate process is over.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: We'll send the document to the address you specify, and we'll mail it to you.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're recording that call.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Good luck. The loan you're applying for is 10 million.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Let's see, for a $10 million coupon payment, you're going to get $120,000, $125,000, $130,000, and this coupon payment that's going to happen right here is being fully funded by our bank.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: However, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, due to the procedure of the grant, I think we need to clarify that our bank is going to give you an initial grant of 120,000 rubles.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Except for that amount, for the remaining $100,000, you'll need to verify the receipts you deposited into the account of the attorney who will take care of the business on your behalf.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: The reason we're doing this is so that we can have legal effect with you and your attorney, and once your client's account has been credited to your lawyer's account anonymously, we need to have a complete set of supporting documents.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: With the supporting documents that you submit, we can have legal effect with you and your attorney, so that we can issue a promissory note on your behalf, and once the $100,000 promissory notes have been processed, the $10 million you applied for and the $100,000 you've deposited will be processed.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: If it's not, then there's no reason to go through the authentication process.\nreceiver: Oh, please.\ncaller: If that happens, the attorney in charge will refund $100,000 to your client's account.\nreceiver: Oh, so you're saying I have to pay ten grand?\ncaller: Yes, it does.\nreceiver: When?\ncaller: Anyway, if you take the exam today, file the paperwork now, and then go to the application process, you'll get a call from your client in an hour or two, but no matter how fast you prepare the paperwork and file it, it's not until 6:30 that the examining officer will call your client, and then you won't be able to execute the loan today, because between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m., you're getting a series of loans from people who are married.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: But if you're willing to do it, I think it's only fair that you do it tomorrow.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: And because we have attorneys on call every four minutes, the hours of operation vary from time to time, and you have to tell us when you're ready to make your withdrawal, and we'll send you a legal entity withdrawal account that's ready to make its withdrawal at that time.\nreceiver: So you're saying to other people that there's no financial process in the process of originating a loan?\ncaller: Thank you for being honest, but your client asks politely, \"Isn't this your voice peeping?\"\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: I've been working here for five years now, and some of you ask me politely, like, \"What's wrong with you?\" I'll explain it to you. I don't know if you'll believe this, but there are more than 500 savings banks in Korea, and there are hundreds of savings banks that I don' t know about.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: So in the case of our Sunshine Bank, our Sunshine Savings Bank or that private portal is listed next to a personal portal, Neighbor or something, and then at our headquarters, we ask you to pay and take it down and delete it, because there are a lot of people who misuse our website as a front for voice phishing or other bad practices that our customers are worried about, so we're deliberately not letting our website be directed by our existing customers, or if you're nervous, there's the first option, which is that the customer can personally appoint a lawyer and proceed, and if that happens, we're there to handle the full payment of the public debt.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: So what happens if I do the first one?\ncaller: I'll tell you what, you name the court where your client is located, you name one of the law firms that are there, and then you have a process where you can have your attorney call you directly from that law firm, and you give us the phone number of that law firm's attorney, and because we're our own lawyers, we have a process of scheduling, and I think that's the cleanest way to go about it.\nreceiver: Are you talking about where we work?\ncaller: Your customers are comfortable.\nreceiver: Oh, well, the work area is convenient, so we'll use it as a work area.\ncaller: A member of a legal entity may be appointed by your attorney.\nreceiver: Counselor, when you hire this lawyer, what do you say?\ncaller: I'm trying to get a loan from a bank, or a savings bank, or an income-guaranteed loan, and I'm just going to use my income as collateral, and they're going to say, \"Can you help me with this paperwork?\" And then they'll say, \"Well, if you ask me, how much will the paperwork cost?\"\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: If you send us the amount you've requested and a receipt for your fee, we'll refund you up to that amount.\nreceiver: Oh yes, I see. I get the point.\ncaller: Check it out, call me back tomorrow if you're sure you want to.\nreceiver: Okay, I'll make a call to this one.\ncaller: I'll need you to file your papers, but first, a certificate of residency.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, all right.\ncaller: Oh, I see.\nreceiver: Okay, when these two are ready, this is the fax number, right?\ncaller: Oh, my God. This ball's right here.\nreceiver: Yes, this way.\ncaller: Oh, that's six balls. That's the six ball.\nreceiver: Let's see if we can figure it out.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.

And I want to work on these things and try to improve on the things I want to say to my friends, or the things that I have in my head, but I'm trying a lot, and I try a lot to practice before I speak, and try a little bit of mind control, and a lot of things like that.\ncaller: And I think it's hard for people to fix the personality that they have, because people have different experiences in different environments, and all of these things, and I think everyone has different values, and so I think that it's impossible to perfectly change the original personality that you had, the original nature that you had as if you were a completely different person, but I think that one of the personalities that you have that you think is problematic is that you have to try to improve it in order to change it for yourself and for other people.\nreceiver: I think it's important for a coach to speak his mind, but it's more important to respect other people's stories and listen to them, but I think if a coach is too lax, if he's too caught up in what other people are saying, if he doesn't get the point across, then I think that coaches have a lot of leverage, so I think if I'm going to be Joe's coach, I want to be able to listen to other coaches and not be too rigid about it, but I want to listen to the other coaches, and I want to organize and combine those skills, and then I want to lead that coach, and if you have a friend who's struggling with these traits around you, or you want to fix these things, can you tell me what your personality is?\ncaller: I think one of the people around me has the opposite personality to me, and I'm a bit of a prankster, and I think I have that personality where I can be emotionally taken in by the other person's jokes, and he's a person who's been emotionally taken out by my jokes, but I've been emotionally hurt a lot, not intentionally, because I've seen too many inconsistencies where I didn't mean to, and it's been a little bit hard, and I can't change his personality completely, but when I think about my position, if I could tell him to fix it, I would like him to be a little bit more flexible and emotionally accepted, because he may have done something intentionally or with bad intentions.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Before the recording, we were afraid to conceal or cover up Article 155 Section 12 of the Criminal Code, the crime of destruction of evidence, 152 forgery of testimony, 132 Section 1 of the Public Enforcement Act, and I will specify the points that are added to the recording investigation.\nreceiver: I'll record with you.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. Are you ready? We're going to record you.\ncaller: Are you the party?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you know Kim Tae Hyun, a 40-year-old man who lives in Seoul, South Korea? In the past two years, have you had your identity card, passport, wallet, cell phone, or other personal information stolen or lost?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you have any idea that on October 13, 2014, you personally opened two branches of the ASEAN National Bank at the Yongle Shopping Mall in Seoul?\nreceiver: No, there isn't.\ncaller: Now that we've said that there is no evidence that the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development, which has been used for crimes in my name, has now opened the transaction itself, now that we're going to freeze these two transactions, which are now used for crimes, are you going to do anything about it?\nreceiver: Yeah, I didn't know.\ncaller: Do you have a receipt in your name or in the name of someone in your family that you've given to a third party?\nreceiver: No, there isn't.\ncaller: Do you have any? Do you have a lot of blond hair?\nreceiver: I don't think I do that much.\ncaller: We don't do that much, we're just using the same currency exchange method that we're using now to avoid secondary damage, and I'm just going to keep it simple, and the reason why we're asking this is because we didn't recognize these two bills, the National Bank of Korea, but now that we do, we don't know for sure whether these bills were paid to Kim Tae Woong or whether they were actually stolen.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'd like to ask you a question.\nreceiver: I can't hear you on the phone right now. Can you say that one more time?\ncaller: So now we're saying that you didn't even notice that these two accounts were being used illegally at all, so now we are going to treat those two accounts and all of the accounts that you're using the same way, and since we can't do that until you actually use them, I'm just going to tell you that in a very simple way.\nreceiver: But don't use the Straits or the National Bank. Just do that.\ncaller: Where did you say you were?\nreceiver: That's not all you can do with the KSC and the National Bank.\ncaller: So we're going to do two things, the CSTO and now the National Bank.\nreceiver: Yeah, that's it. That's the only leak.\ncaller: I'm going to do these two things, and now we don't even know what else we're using, and other than that, we have no idea about the wallet at the moment. I think Kim Seok Hyun is basically an overpaid worker at the National Bank for eight months, so he opened the wallet so easily. So we're not just asking you to give us the account number and password of the financial token you're using right now, we're just using the wallet of the new bank as a deposit account.\nreceiver: Corporate bank accounts\ncaller: So you don't understand why we're asking this now?\nreceiver: No, I got it.\ncaller: Do you understand? Do you understand clearly?\nreceiver: Yeah, yeah, I got it.\ncaller: I'm going to tell you one thing at a time.\nreceiver: There's no money in the checking account.\ncaller: If you don't have anything like a negative balance, and you only use a corporate bank deposit account, then beyond that, do you agree with us browsing and browsing?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I agree with you, except for one corporate bank, and then after we did some research, we all had accounts, just for a moment, you have a corporate bank that you use as a checking account.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: I don't know if you have a balance, but do you mind if I take a look?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: We're going to freeze all the accounts and then we'll investigate.\ncaller: Yes, you did, but I'm going to stop the recording.\nreceiver: How are you?\ncaller: We'll finish the recording and we'll call you back later if there's anything special.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, he did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}

It may be outrageous, but this case, when a man named Gangsun Hoon is now running an illegal gambling site. Because he needs a bulletproof notice, he has been contacted by stating that he has bought tickets to 130 people across the country, including himself, and this is the part where he is contacted. As we are talking now, those civilians are the ones who have received money and sold them, and since then they have been contacted to confirm the policy. But you have not sold any tickets at all.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And by the way, you should know that under the Penal Code of the People's Republic of China, anyone who sells an instrument to another person can be sentenced to a prison term of up to three years or a fine of up to 30 million yen, so what you're saying is that you don't know anything about it and have nothing to do with it?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, have you ever clicked on something like a spam text message lately?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: He's never had one.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: First of all, since there are no charges in this case, I'd like you to come to my office to be investigated, but when can you come to the Busan High Prosecutor's Office?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: I'd like you to come to Detective 1 of the Busan District Attorney's Office.\nHow soon can you come?\nreceiver: Do you have to go?\ncaller: Do you have a problem with the streets?\nreceiver: Do I have to go?\ncaller: So now that you've asked me to come to the DA's office, do you have any other business?\nreceiver: I was on a course to get to Busan.\ncaller: You're in a lecture hall, and I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you at work or at home?\nreceiver: Right now?\ncaller: It's yours.\nreceiver: He's at home now.\ncaller: You're at home, you're on the streets, and it's hard for you to come?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you say yes to that, you'll have to be investigated by the prosecutor's office, because there's an allegation of involvement in this case, and I'm going to ask you a few questions to determine whether or not you're a first-degree murderer, and the general investigation will be conducted on tape, and in the course of the investigation, whether we're in a rape investigation, whether it's a forensic interrogation, and if you're making a false statement, it's going to be reviewed by another agency, and you can't lie or hide, because this recording is going to be used as evidence in a robbery trial.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I'm Detective Director of the First Unit of the Busan High Prosecutor's Office, and I'm currently in the process of completing a one-on-one investigation into the financial affair of Brother 13,758 in 2015.\nAre you correct about the name of the party?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I'm a 45-year-old man, 71 years old, do you know anyone named Kang San-hoon?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Have you ever opened a Busan Bank account on June 9th, 2015 at a branch of Busan Bank?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So this June 9th, between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., where were you?\nreceiver: I don't have a good memory.\ncaller: If you look at the paperwork, it's Tuesday.\nreceiver: I don't remember what I said.\ncaller: Don't you remember anything?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now that you understand what I'm talking about, did you already know that at the moment, the items in Mr. Sun's name are being used illegally in the case of the robust ship?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: Is this the first time you've said that you've been dealing with a bankrupt bank that you're currently dealing with legally?\nreceiver: The bank?\ncaller: Yes, the Bank of Busan\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: You've never traded in Busan, so who do you mainly trade with now?\nreceiver: What the hell are you doing?\ncaller: Is there only one strait?\nreceiver: Do you use the Straits or a bank or something?\ncaller: Yes. So if you're a citizen of this bank that you mentioned, or of any other bank except Hanukkah Bank, or any other bank other than Hanukkah, or if your bank account has been destroyed, we're going to admit that the leakage of your personal information is an illegal act by criminals, and we are going to forcibly freeze all of you. Do you agree?\nreceiver: What's this?\ncaller: So you didn't say you were dealing with the Bank of China and the Bank of Agriculture and Development?\nreceiver: What's that?\ncaller: So what you're saying is that in a bank other than the Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development, for example, the National Bank, or our bank, if that counter is found, because it's a citizen's counter, you're also admitting that Busan was opened by criminals, and you're forcing all of us to be frozen.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Do you have any other banks besides the Bank of Agriculture and Cooperation?\ncaller: I think there's something that I'm working on right now, and I think I've written a little bit about the Sanctuary, and there's a few of them, and then there's all of them.\nreceiver: The National Bank, our bank, does business in places like this.\ncaller: I've made it before.\nreceiver: But they're all human, aren't they?\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: So if another bank comes up during our investigation, you're going to ask them, and you're not going to admit that Mr. Sun Tzu admitted that it was opened by criminals, and you are going to force them all to shut down.\nreceiver: You don't know what I'm talking about.\ncaller: So you didn't say that there are other banks besides Hanbank and the Bank of Agriculture and Cooperation, but now you say that you don't remember, for example, the National Bank of Uzbekistan, when you come out of this place, you will ask, \"Do you have an account opened by Mr. Iengil?\"\nreceiver: If you get a text like this, if you confirm it, it freezes, and if you don't, it doesn't freeze?\ncaller: So yes, if you admit that you opened the money order, you'll let it go, but if you don't admit it, then you'll admit that the criminals opened it, and you'll have the statistics processed. Understand? I'm hanging up.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Now, if you say that you're mainly dealing with the One Bank Agricultural Bank, when you're dealing with a bank, are you more likely to be dealing directly with the warehouse, or are you more inclined to use Internet banking or mobile banking?\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm using all of my Internet banking and mobile banking.\ncaller: Yes, but if you say that you use internet banking or mobile banking, have you set your security settings to OTP?\nreceiver: I think it's a security card.\ncaller: It's called a security card, and it's a security card with numbers one through thirty on it, and the OTP is a machine-readable format that converts the OTP into numbers every 30 or 60 seconds, and that's the OTP.\nreceiver: It's not that.\ncaller: You've never been lost, have you?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Do you know the date of the last transaction with that bank?\nreceiver: In the case of a bank,\ncaller: Yes, you've made a deposit or a withdrawal, eaten a meal, used a card, browsed an account.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, well, when you were trading last week, did you notice any strange trading patterns?\nreceiver: No, I don't think that happened.\ncaller: You've never had any -- yes, you've never seen any financial losses -- but how many ATMs do you use?\nreceiver: One of them.\nreceiver: If you don't want to be financially damaged, how much money do you have left to protect from the Treasury?\ncaller: $87 million. This is a standard entry receipt.\nreceiver: You have to have 87 million yen, and if you say that the Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development has not been affected, what is the approximate amount you have to be protected?\nreceiver: There's 40 million of them.\ncaller: Yes, I understand, this is a normal filling station, and this is what you're saying, so can you tell me one thing that's absolutely true about all of this?\nreceiver: He's with me. Talk to me.\ncaller: Yes, if you're not telling the truth, you're adding perjury and obstruction of justice, and if you find any additional charges, you'll be subpoenaed for questioning, and you say you're at home right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, just write down the case number and tell me you're ready when you are.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: For example, the stronghold financial case of 2015 FRA 1375.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Could you read the note again, please?\nreceiver: This is the case of the stronghold finance case No. 1375.\ncaller: I'm going to put you on the phone with the district attorney in a few minutes, and when you do, you're going to tell me about the incident that you wrote down, and you can tell me who you are, and you're a victim of this incident, but you're drawing a street map, and you cannot come to my office because of your job, so you can be the account tracker and prove that you're the innocent victim.\nAnd if, during the recording, you ask me about the opening of the bus station in Busan, I'll tell you that I had no idea what was going on, and maybe the prosecutor will tell you who the victims are, and I'll take all the necessary measures to make sure that they don't get hurt, do you understand?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're a detective with the Busan High Prosecutor's Office. One of you is a sewer inspector.\nreceiver: How are you?\ncaller: Say yes. I'll put you on the phone and you'll be on the case number, right? What's the case number?\nreceiver: It's called the 2015 Form 1375 robbery finance case.\ncaller: All right, well, hold on a second. I'll check the paperwork, and I'll get right to it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You are right.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I've been checking all these documents in front of you, so now on the side of the court, if the container has been used, if the arrest warrant has already been issued, and if the freezing of bank assets has already been released. First of all, during the investigation, when our investigator contacted us, he said that he did not know anyone named Ragshan Khore and had never been involved in these cases.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I think that's one of the things that we can do is cooperate with the financial regulators and the banks to investigate the status of your account, to look at your six-month cash flow, to see if you've had any dealings with these illegals, and if you're caught dealing with illegal assets, we're going to have a robbery warrant or a bank property incentive, and vice versa, if you are a victim, we can also provide you with a security guard so that you don't have any damage, and then later, if the victim's identity is confirmed, we'll send you an application to be included in the property protection application.\ncaller: What am I supposed to do?\nreceiver: Well, first of all, today, right now, you're going to have to log into the account tracking system yourself, and now you have to go through the reporting process.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: And if you finish the investigation today, tomorrow, or the next day, one of our investigators will be there, because there are a lot of victims on both sides of the aisle, and I think we're going to have to meet now, and you'll have to check all the documents, and then you'll just have to sign your name at the end, and that's the only way you'll be able to get rid of this case completely.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: Today you have to go through the reporting process. Yes, and when we were tracking it, we found something really strange. So there are some things that you have to deal with. So if you're in a situation where you can't come, you have to monitor everything. Now you have to do the same thing when you come to Busan. Yes, you agree, so you have to make a phone call.\ncaller: What are we gonna do?\nreceiver: First of all, I'm applying for a pharmaceutical study because it's an impossible situation, and because the entire preliminary process is being recorded.\nThere are times when you may or may not want to hang up the phone, and when you and your colleague are talking on the phone, where do you think your personal information has been leaked?\ncaller: I don't know.\nreceiver: I don't know. Are you saying you didn't know that much? Are you saying that you did not know that there had been leaks before?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Okay, well, first of all, have you ever tried an idea keeper before?\ncaller: I don't know.\nreceiver: So stay home, stay home, because there's been a lot of bank-related incidents, you know, and now there's a lot of other incidents, like credit cards, credit card information leaks, telecommunications leaks, and so on, but first of all, this is a situation where a lot of victims are coming out, and we've found a lot of commonalities. You know, the bank receipts that you used to use, the receipts were completely broken, so a lot of people went to sleep and woke up, and they were almost out of the savings, and some of them even looked at the minus counter or the credit card losses, and for various reasons, how did you deal with so many receipts?\ncaller: What's that?\nreceiver: You need to download that ID ID certificate. Where did you download it?\ncaller: I saved it on a flash drive.\nreceiver: But you put it in a USB, so you've never stored it in a computer before, and you're like, \"Well, that's great, you've done a pretty good job of keeping it in a separate USB, but you still have a USB\".\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Every valid certificate has, in fact, a certificate file or a certificate folder name, and I'm going to tell you what that folder name is, and I hope that you'll listen to it, and then you'll look at it, and you'll check each and every one of them, and there'll be some weird stuff, and then when you go through the reporting process, you'll be able to track your location, and if you find an IP address that you've registered overseas, we'll talk to you personally.\ncaller: I've never seen it before.\nreceiver: OK, so you've logged into our central server, and you're going to the Privacy Breach Reporting Center, and now you can go through the reporting process yourself, and not just with your case number, but with your name, and you can see for yourself what kind of incident you're involved in. First of all, is your computer booting right now?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: You're saying the computer is booted. Is that your laptop?\ncaller: It's the laptop.\nreceiver: The laptop is fine, if it's booting up right now, connect it to the USB, and you're connected.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: Now, first of all, I want you to open up an Internet window, and if you open an Internet window and you look at the top of it, you'll see an address box, and I'm going to clean out all the addresses in that address box.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}

Of course, it varies from country to country, but in my country, I think it's more like high school, where you go for the ability to get in, and I think it feels more like a high school where a group of people come together in one place, and they study together, and they run for the same goal, whereas in college, you have a little more autonomy than in high school, and you have more opportunities to make your own choices.\ncaller: Yes, I've been in the workforce for about a year, and I'm very negative about retreats, and I enjoyed drinking when I was in college, and I still do, but I'm really negative about retreat, and I think that retreats should be arranged by people who really want to, on the day they want to, in the place they want to. And if they don't want to, I have a personal desire to give them some assurance so that they can go home and relax after work.\nreceiver: I agree with what you said earlier, but I don't think it's a good idea to be so coercive with your subordinates that they can't do what they want to do for themselves or have time for themselves.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Have you ever tried dieting?\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm a really good weight-loss bodybuilder, and I'm so stressed out right now that I lost 30 kilos in my junior year of high school, and then I almost lost 100 kilos, and then it was closer to 100 kilos. And then I started doing a real diet, and now I'm in my senior year, and now because I didn't study very much, I've gained 30 kilos again, and now it's just before I'm able to do it, and that diet has a really good way and a really bad way, and I think I've been dieting in a really bad manner, and now every day I'm just eating three bagels a day, and I was just running on a treadmill for three hours a day, but now I see that the side effect is that all the muscle in my body is losing weight, and now all I have left is that I'm not losing weight properly, and I don't have any muscle anymore, so I'm going to have to hold it in a little bit of a nutritional clutch until I'm at home, so I guess I'll have\ncaller: I've been on a diet for about three years now, and I've only had one success, and it was when I stopped taking health supplements for a month, and I saved money, and I went out every day, and then I had a boyfriend, and I thought I had to make a change in my appearance, and I said, \"I've lost 10 kilos in a month, but this is called Galen, and there's a health supplement called green and green and red, and I didn't eat that, and I ate two liters of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I walked to and from health every day, I didn' t take a taxi or a bus, and so I've gained 10 kilos by 10 kilos, and that' s just after a short month, and 10 kilos are back, and so the health supplements really have too many side effects, and I don' t think there' s any fantastic change in the advertising, so I thought, \"Well, you know, the health supplement has to be highlighted\", so I said,\nreceiver: Yes, if you're on that diet, it's good to go on a diet and eat well, but now you have to eat protein, what you need, what you should eat, take more vitamins, etc. You don't have any such knowledge, and now you just eat three random gourds, you lose all your weight and now you'll feel better, so I thought this is really unhealthy, I just dieted and just starved, but now I'm honest, I'm on a daily diet every day, so now I tell people around me, you can't be malnourished every day, you don't eat food because you're not used to it, now you must take care in the morning and take carbohydrates properly, now you're no longer a yoyo phenomenon, oh, you can go all the way, so I'll give you this advice, now I know for sure, now I've lost weight, now I want to take some examples of how to lose weight, now women who are trying to lose weight are so hungry, I think they're eating a diet, but now they're hungry for a\ncaller: I'm on a diet, I'm exercising, I've been doing kickboxing for about a month now, and I've done the kickboxing, the baseline jumping, the three-minute stretching and the kick kick kick, and I think that's helped a lot, and I was wondering if, you know, you look very healthy right now, but have you ever had a similar illness?\nreceiver: What I would call a disease right now is that I have acupuncture or something like that, and I've had a lot of what I'd call a disease, but I've never had it, whether I'm healthy or not, and I don't think I've been traumatized a lot, traumatically, when I was a kid, I'd get stabbed in a tree or punched in a TV, I've gotten a little bit of this kind of trauma, and now I've done a lot of surgeries in that direction, and I got a lot of injuries that way, and I think I haven't gotten any disease.\ncaller: I didn't have a major illness, but I had a recent one, and I had to have an operation, and it was a big one, but I have to tell you, it's an ovarian tumor, and I'm a little confused, and I have to have the surgery, so it's a hip replacement surgery, and it's not supposed to bleed outwardly, and women shouldn't be seen outwardly.\nreceiver: Now, I think that when I'm stressed, if I focus more on something, I forget about the stress, so I do the hard work, or I play a game, or I exercise, or I have a conversation with these friends, and I drink, and I think the best way to relieve stress is to exercise, and the worst way is to drink, because I like alcohol so much, and it's a stress reliever, mentally, but my organs in my body are also stressed, so I'm trying to reduce stress.\ncaller: I've been working out to relieve stress in the beginning, and I've had this weird thing where I work out more, and I sweat my way through a diploma, and that relieves the stress, and it builds up my self-esteem, and when I work out, it builds my self-respect, and then when I study and build up my A spectrum, it adds up to more and more self-responsibility, and that's how I relieve stress, and every time I'm stressed, I go out with my friends and have a drink, and I think that's even worse for my health, so I'm kind of positive about trying to avoid stress by eating one, two, three times a week, and sometimes one or two times a week.\nreceiver: I like to take some pills, so I take a lot of those nutrients, and now one of them is called a cutting agent, and now there's a kind of cutting agent that makes you sweat more when you exercise and reduces fat absorption a little bit, but it's too much, and now if it doesn't fit your body, you get diarrhea, and you have diarrhea or diarrhoea, and it's really extreme, and this is something that I use a lot, because I'm very sensitive to my intestines, and I'm always diarrhoeing, and sometimes I'm diarrhea-prone, and then I feel like it's not good for me anymore, and lately I've been taking probiotics, and now I've got a lot of my bacteria, and I eat a lot of them, and so I'm trying to improve my side effects with other drugs, and I think that's the kind of probiotics that actually fit my body, but I've found four or five different types of probiotic that fit my body.\ncaller: I'm trying not to eat fish because, as I said before, it's called Zyalan, and it's a green tea extract that removes fat, and I've been having side effects, and I don't want to take the medication, so I'm not taking the medication separately, and I am trying to eat a healthy diet, and there are a lot of cases of people taking medication, and there's a lot of celebrities who are taking medication and they're taking drugs, and they have a lot of these side effects, so they're not trying to eat fish.\nreceiver: Now, I'm not a very good at exercising, so now I'm in the gym, and I'm exercising two hours a day, and it's just too much exercise, and I used to do a lot of it, and now later on, I've got a little bit of muscle tearing in my shoulders and stuff like that, and I was trying to cut back a little bit, so I'm doing two hours per day, but it's not my fault, because originally, I had a lumbar disc, and I had a really, really hard workout, and I wanted to loosen up the lumbar disc a little bit.\ncaller: I don't have a rehab illness, and I've heard a lot about rehab, and a lot of my friends are in rehab, so I hear a lot about it, but can I ask you if there's been any cases where you've overcome a major illness around rehab without doing it alone?\nreceiver: Yeah, the boys are playing a little bit too much now, so I've got a lot of people around me who are doing some rehabilitation now, and I have a friend who was trying to rehabilitate his lumbar disc like me, and he had a worse one than I did, and I had a fifth vertebrae, and there was only one ruptured disc, and he's had a second, third, and two ruptured discs.\ncaller: I don't take a lot of essential vitamins, and I don' t care too much, I just think it' s better for my health to take them later in life, so I won' t take them separately.\nreceiver: Now, women say that the lower body needs to be hot, the lower body has to be hot and it needs to be a little bit hot, so obviously, if you go to the gym now, most of the time, when you get a little bit of fitness, the fitness trainers make you sweat, make you run, and you just do it, and obviously, that exercise is good for women's health, but if you talk about upper-body exercise, there's a lot of energy that's lacking.\ncaller: My parents always tell me that my back hurts, and they're very interested in my back, and I don't know if it's the rehabilitation treatment for my back, but I haven't seen any discomfort with anything other than my back. They say that my neck and my throat and my collarbone are very sore, and then I sit down on the computer a little bit, and there's a lot of stuff about my shoulders and shoulders, and I'm very interested in that part of my back. Do you care about your parents' health?\nreceiver: My father is suffering from constipation, and constipation gets worse when he eats a lot of meat and beer, so now every time I go, I'm collecting all the beer in the fridge, and now the sauce is fine, and I'm bringing it home and making it the way I eat it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

It was once every three years.\ncaller: Do you remember when or if you came out?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: And just so you know, the reason I'm asking this part of the question is, why don't you make one copy of your ID card every time you change your phone?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I've asked you before, and in the last five years, have you ever had your ID card or utility card lost or stolen?\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: You said you didn't, and are you currently doing business with SC Standard Plumber?\nreceiver: There is no deal.\ncaller: If you're a Human account, you have to say something.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And have you used internet banking, smart banking, and telebanking in the meantime?\nreceiver: I've used all of it from time to time.\ncaller: Well, have you used all three?\nreceiver: No, I'm just using phone banking and going to the bank or something.\ncaller: And just for the record, have you ever had any money transferred or deposited into your bank account that you didn't know you were using?\nreceiver: It never happened.\ncaller: Have you ever transferred or deposited funds that you didn't know about?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Okay, so what you've said so far is accurate, and you're telling the truth?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yes, if you have a false statement, you can call the Office of False Statements and the Electoral District Office.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We've arrested these criminals for this case, whether there are additional accomplices to these criminals, and whether there was any involvement by the bank's employees, and this is a situation that we're currently investigating.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If we just look at the cases that we've uncovered so far, whether you're unknowingly accessing your personal cell phone on behalf of a private lender or a large lender, pretending to be you, and applying for a loan, and then when the money comes out, you intercept it, or whether you've managed your deposits online, your deposits, your fund's securities minus your money order, these are the areas where the graphics of transferring and withdrawing funds are being transmitted by hacking your mobile phone over the Internet, and in these areas, you're also very exposed to two- and three-dimensional images, and that's why we're setting up protective surveillance measures.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Protective surveillance means that for those of you who, like you, have been involved in a data breach or a misappropriation, you can access and monitor our police department's main device servers during the course of an investigation, and I'll leave you with a final note.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Not only you, but everyone involved in this case will have access to a primary account number search, and at the same time as this account tracking search, you should know that all the bank notes and credit cards you use have been suspended during our investigation.\nreceiver: Yeah, how long does it take?\ncaller: We estimate that it will take roughly 60 days to 90 days.\nreceiver: No, how does one live?\ncaller: Now, as I'm explaining this to you right now, the reason for the suspension of payments is that it's a necessary part of the investigation process, which is unnecessary because it could conceal illicit funds or destroy evidence, and in this process, you yourself should not be suspended.\nreceiver: I have to use the card or the receipt during the investigation.\ncaller: If you have any of these complaints, we will prioritize the implementation of the Bank Note Deposit Protection Act before it goes into effect. The bank note that has been applied first is the first to be implemented. The banknote in question can be deposited, withdrawn and used in the same way as before by our investigators.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: However, in the event that we have implemented this banknote deposit protection law in the first place, if you have confirmed the illegal flow of funds or the illegal increase of property in that bank during our investigation, you must immediately notify our Seoul District Police Department immediately. You yourself are a victim, and I am a victim.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: So the banknote that we're not supposed to suspend, that you're supposed to actually use, that our investigative agency is supposed to use, where is that banknote?\nreceiver: It doesn't matter where.\ncaller: There's only one bank that you actually have to use, and that's our bank, and the depositor protection application, and the other banking authorization in your name, other than our bank's authorization, is fine, even if you go into our investigation period or suspension of payments.\nreceiver: It's a living.\ncaller: And what about those liquid funds that I'm talking about in our wallets, that are exposed to the current secondary and tertiary damage that I've been talking about, you can give me a rough estimate of, say, $1 million or more, or $5 million or less, or more.\nreceiver: 100 to 500 microns.\ncaller: Let me ask you this, have you ever opened a minus counter in your wallet that could cause secondary or tertiary damage?\nreceiver: No, there's no such thing.\ncaller: Now, our bank account will be available to you for the duration of our investigation, so I'll file a report with the Financial Supervisory Authority, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact our investigations department at any time.\nreceiver: Can I reach you at this number?\ncaller: This is a recorded call, so please leave a note. 02-6469.\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\ncaller: Three hundred and three.\nreceiver: This is 0303.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I wrote it down.\ncaller: If you have any questions, please contact me at any time.\nreceiver: I got it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}

Bank, immigration counselor. How can I help you?\ncaller: I'm trying to set up a short-term savings account, but can I get a wired consult?\ncaller: There are two types of short-term savings accounts, because I don't know which one is more suitable for me.\ncaller: One is a youth savings account, so you can open an account between the ages of 18 and 29, and the other is a general short-term savings account that doesn't seem to have any age restrictions, so I was wondering what the difference is.\nreceiver: Interest rates are different.\ncaller: I don't know what the interest rate is, but I wonder if it's right to calculate it based on the annual interest rate, for example, if you have deposited 10,000 yuan for a year, is it right to charge interest at a certain percentage of the 10,000 yuan base?\ncaller: Oh, so the interest rate on the Youth Savings Bond is up to 1.2% higher than other savings bonds, right?\ncaller: So if I'm 28 now, and I'm signing a two-year contract, and I have to use the product until I'm 30, can I still use the product without an age restriction?\ncaller: Or because it's a 29-year-old standard, is it automatically a 29-year old standard for products, products that are only available for one year?\nreceiver: You can be up to 30 years old as of the date you first joined.\ncaller: So you're saying that because it's a first-time membership, you can only sign up until you're 29, and then there's no automatic termination or premature expiration?\ncaller: Thank you for your consultation, and if you'd like to open an additional account, please let me know if it's possible to do so by wire or visiting the site.\nreceiver: You have to visit the site.\ncaller: How would I know the items of paperwork that I would need if I was going to go in for a consultation and sign up, if all I could find on the Internet was a copy of an ID card, a retirement certificate, a salary statement for the last three months, a business registration certificate?\ncaller: When we started, we were going to create a short-term savings account, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, with a total of three products, right?\ncaller: We know that the difference between the three commodities is that they have different interest rates on the annuity, but is that correct?\ncaller: So I'm 28 years old now, and I'm hoping for 36 months, so I'm entitled to the 2.5% annual interest rate that's in the product description?\ncaller: If I'm currently a client of a CS bank, and I'm a client of the CS bank, is there no additional benefit?\nreceiver: The fake goods are refined.\ncaller: Is it true that if you sign up by December 31st, 2020, you're going to win a raffle to upgrade your new iPad?

The atmosphere is a little bit cool, but then Trump is also in the United States anyway, his position or political position is a little threatened, but then the bombing of the contact office is not how, but the building built on the promise of each other in the country and some kind of symbolic building that is discussed, this is not even savages, but when I saw the article, I thought that this is a wild normal, of course, the system of North Korea itself is not normal, but acting like this is so wild, I just thought that the building was blown up so Kim Jong-un is also Kim Jong-il, but this is the wrong thing, if Kim Jong-Un is wrong, I will be sorry more and more when I see the article\ncaller: Kim Jong-un stayed calm, and Kim Jong-il couldn't have been stronger, and I thought that maybe I was the second person in the world, and I was the next person after my brother in a hundred blood vessels, and I didn't do this deliberately to show off, but I saw on another YouTube broadcast that the North Korean separatist group in our country sprayed something like that, and that's what it was originally not supposed to do, but we agreed with each other not to do it, but we were so excited that we did it, because the country didn't implement it, and the content of the question of the pipe was that Kim Jong-Un was very angry and just such a giant, so when our people saw this, the first ambassador sent from North Korea, Kim Jong-Il, was almost like a god.\nreceiver: But Kim Jong-un's health is a little weird, and he hasn't shown his face for a while, but he still doesn't show his face like that, so it seems like there's something wrong with his health.\ncaller: I don't know, Kim Jong-un just died, there was a lot of talk about it, but I didn't see him before, but when I saw him on the TV, he had been in 21 days before. Yes, he said that he would definitely be in 21 days, and he really said that he was a researcher who was the Minister of Unification during the presidency of Kim Jong-Un, and he said he knew very well about North Korea.\nreceiver: It's a little personal, but I don't think my health is what it used to be.\ncaller: And he said that he looked so fat, and he smoked so much.\nreceiver: And that's the first time he said that his face had been out for a while, and then when his face came out, it was like a vehicle that he used to use when he was sick.\ncaller: And they're saying that because of the coronavirus, they went to the apartment because they wanted to get away from the coronavirus. Yes, this coronavirus is completely real, there are a lot of real deaths all over the world, and these days, Trump is just about to be re-elected, and it seems like he doesn't really care about North Korea, so our country and just President Moon and our country and North Korea and our country have to solve between each other, and we have to take the United States, China and whatever, four-party talks and everything else out of the equation.\nreceiver: And I think we're a little bit too weak to do that, and I'm a little bit frustrated as a citizen of this country that we're the ones who are actually always going to have China and Japan and the United States and all the other great powers come out and then we're just going to have to follow the consequences, but we have to get rid of nuclear, and so do we, and so will our children.\ncaller: We need to completely denuclearize the country now, because with that kind of money, North Korea doesn't make weapons like this, and if all that money is spent on the people of North Korea, the country will be better off.\nreceiver: I think there's only one thing Kim Jong-un can't let go of, and that's that the world is throwing its weight around on that small country, and he's got the most dangerous nuclear weapon in the world.\ncaller: Kim Jong-un, Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il Kim Jong-Il Kim Jong-Un, in the midst of all the enemies of North Korea here and there, Kim Jong is the God who made history, this era of peace will return, and in the future, there will be no more wars between each other these days, so I hope that our country will be united soon, because the era and the three world generations are passing, so we hope that in our time when we are alive\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Do you have a teenage dream, and you don't dream about being a baseball player in your 20s?\ncaller: Yes, it's different. When I was younger, I had a lot of opportunities to learn and a lot of free time, so I had many goals that allowed me to challenge this and that, but now that I'm working and earning a living, I think the future is a distant future. Do you have any goals that you're dreaming about right now?\nreceiver: Yeah, I've been dreaming about this for a while, and I haven't been dreaming what we normally call a dream, but lately I've started dreaming again, and right now I'm thinking about going back to school and getting ready to be a civil servant, and I know it's hard, but I'm going to try, and I'll try, and if I don't get there, I'll give up, but right now I think of civil service as a dream, right now do you have any dreams to think about?\ncaller: Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about broadcasting for a long time, and I wanted to show people that I'm really bright, and I was thinking about the kind of challenge that a lot of people are facing these days, like being a YouTube creator or an Internet platform broadcaster, and it's a job that's highly sought after and competitive, so it's going to be a lot of challenges, but for once, I don't think it's wrong to try to work towards the future that I want.\nreceiver: The right jobs to have at the moment are, I think, the most stable public servants, and the most popular YouTube creators these days are the VJs, but I think these two require a lot more effort and a lot more dedication than you think, but we think there's no such thing as no effort, and what do you think is the number one or number two dream for teenagers these days?\ncaller: In the case of male students, I think they're thinking a lot about professional gamers, because they love games, and in the case of female students, they're more interested in cosmetics and looks, so they're probably more interested in a career as a YouTuber that shows up in front of people, and I think if I were to go back to my teenage years, I think I'd think about the same dream, and because I live with the same ideas and goals, I think there's a lot of teens and 20s right now who are thinking about being YouTubers or professional gamers.\nreceiver: And I think the most important thing that you need to do in order to achieve your hopes for the future is to persevere and not give up on your dreams, and to strive to make those dreams come true, and first and foremost, if you're an athlete, you need to have the kind of skills that fit your athletic traits, or if you dream of being a civil servant, you need the kind of knowledge that fits that, and if you think about it now, if you were in your 20s and 30s, if you thought about going back 10 years ago, what kind of dreams would you have?\ncaller: I think that if I go back 10 years, I would have a dream job in broadcasting, because it's not so easy to find what I want in life, and I haven't done it, and if I went back a decade, I would put a lot of hard work into it, because there's a lot of competition, and it's a very competitive job, but it's still difficult to challenge.\nreceiver: And I don't think it has anything to do with age, because there's a lot of people in their 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, in the news, in syndicated programs, and I've seen a lot of examples of people dreaming in their teens, and people dreaming late in their 60s and 50s, and I think it doesn't matter how old they are in terms of achieving their dreams, because if you look at the people who are dreaming right now, what do you think they're doing to achieve their dreams?\ncaller: And I think self-management is the most important thing, because you have to manage yourself, and I think you'll be able to achieve your goals without any difficulty, because you'll have enough time to think about yourself internally and externally, and you'll feel confident that you can do anything when you're in front of other people, and you have to have a certain amount of money in order to achieve your dreams, so you have to make sure that you don't let your shortcomings show up in front of people, so you're not ashamed and you're going to be able to confront them properly, because you feel that there's something different about the dreams of mothers and fathers in their 40s and 50s and our dreams now.\nreceiver: The reason that dreams change in your 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s is that your 20s have less responsibility, but when you're in your 30s, 40s, or even 50s, you have a lot of things to take care of, like your home or your job, and you've changed a lot in order to have a stable, stable life, and there's a lot of risk associated with that, but if you just work at it, you don't think it's as big of a change as you think it is, and if you think you have to choose between your dreams and your life, what do you

If you are over 18 years old, you can get a check card if you have a residency certificate and proof of family ties.\ncaller: Oh, right! But I'm an adult now, and I know that my warrant looks like a kid's warrant, so there's a lot of restrictions on what I can do.

Other places seem to be using $100,000/$100,000 per month or more.\ncaller: So you're saying that if you apply for a postpaid transportation card instead of a prepaid one, you'll get a discount?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is there no discount for members who use prepaid transportation cards? They're minors, they're students, they know they can't use credit cards, and they only use gifts.\nreceiver: Prepaid transportation cards, no matter how many times they're recharged, there's no discount.\ncaller: So besides the transportation card, there's a discount on the National Cultural Center, and there's also a discount for places like Lotteworld and Everland, but is there a standard for that?\nreceiver: Discounts for cultural centers designated by Battle+ in the country apply to everyone, but Lotteworld only applies to those who use it for more than one month.\ncaller: So I don't think I'm going to get a very good discount if I use it, so I'm just going to have to get a check card out of the ATM, because I want to get a discount card for these things.\nreceiver: Let me see. Hold on a second.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: I already have a check card, sir.\ncaller: I think I saw on the website that you can get a discount on the entrance fee to the National Designated Cultural Center, and I know that when I use my check card, that amount (0.3%) of money goes into my account, right?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Does that mean I don't have to use it every month for a certain amount of time, plus or minus a certain amount, and I get the full discount?\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: So it's not like a check card, you can just go to the website and apply?\nreceiver: Yes, you can do that by downloading the app and not using it on the website.\ncaller: The last time I downloaded the app and tried to sign up, they said I needed a valid ID, and I don't have a valid ID yet.\ncaller: I'm not using an iPhone, I'm using an Android, and I know that Android doesn't have a separate app, so do I have to go to the accredited certificate website and apply for a membership?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: When you get a valid certificate, do you just sign up and then apply for a card?\nreceiver: Yes, after clicking on it, you can go through the citizenship registration verification process.\ncaller: But, you know, I'm sure you mentioned earlier that you need a certificate of residency and a certificate of family relationship to issue a check card, but you don't do it face-to-face on the app, so it's impossible to verify, so how do you do this?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right, the process of taking a photo of your citizenship card, and if you take it, it's automatically certified.\ncaller: Okay, I'm going to have to go through the process. Oh, how long does it take to apply? I know it's usually one week/seven days, but I have to go play next week. If there's a lot of delay, can I get it later?\ncaller: So what's wrong with that?

It's hard to live in North Korea for a while, and you don't adapt well there, and when you come back to our country, how can you live better and be safer and have a peaceful life, and then you think that you came to our country because we have so many North Koreans on TV, sometimes, and how do we accept these North Koreans so that in the future they can come and settle down in our country and have a stable life, so I think their role will be much bigger, if that happens later, and from a religious point of view too, I think it would be good for them to go to North Koreans and do missionary work for them, or preach the gospel to them, or whatever, but I don't know how we can influence the missionaries\nreceiver: But I think that's a little bit counter-cultural because, you know, if you're in a race like the fake North Korea, and you're carrying around a fake Bible, there's almost no freedom of religion for political prisoners, and you don't really have freedom of religion, it's almost communist ideology, and there's a rejection of religion itself, but especially, well, I know that's true, and in North Korea, this is Christianity itself, the most rejection of Christianity itself, and so the country doesn't have a lot of counter-culture yet, so I think I'd better take it a little bit slower.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

How much money is in there?\ncaller: Yes, because we have to verify whether there is a second tank and whether you have received funds from the Kim Jong-un Party, or whether we have received funds, and the Financial Supervisory Authority has to verify how much it matches your funds.\nreceiver: I'll have to check my smart banking.\ncaller: You don't even know roughly?\nreceiver: What am I? I just got paid this month, and I've been running out of money.\ncaller: Let me give you a rough idea.\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: The payroll at the National Bank doesn't know exactly what it is right now.\ncaller: You could say something like this.\ncaller: How are you?\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm working on it right now.\ncaller: We thought you didn't know how much money you had in your account, but now we think you got money from Kim Jong-un's party.\nreceiver: So there's about 600,000 of them.\ncaller: There's about 600,000 yuan in there.\nreceiver: Then there's the balance sheet, and then there's your savings account, and then on top of that, there's money in the account.\ncaller: What are you in charge of?\nreceiver: It's just a safety deposit box.\ncaller: So if you're talking about what you're thinking about in terms of 100,000 units right now, you're basically just talking about approximations right now.\nreceiver: Maybe a million won.\ncaller: And then,\nreceiver: There's about $100,000 in free cash flow right now.\ncaller: Free entry and exit?\nreceiver: Yeah, it's just a deposit, and then there's a million won left over.\ncaller: Lastly, since the case itself is a financial fraud, I'd like to point out that you can be named in the third person until the victim identification process has been completed.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Secondly, I'm going to ask the warden's team leader or the prosecuting attorney to give me a full description of the damage.\nreceiver: If I want to call back to the station, where do I go?\ncaller: I'll give you the number, but first, write down your case number.\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\ncaller: I'll have the prosecutor explain everything to you again.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Hi, can I have your note?\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\nreceiver: Please say yes.\ncaller: The 2015 survey\nreceiver: Two, ten, one, five.\ncaller: The investigation.\nreceiver: The investigation.\ncaller: I'll put you through to the prosecutor in charge.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I've changed your number, but first, can you give me the case number you got from the investigators?\nreceiver: The 2015 survey\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: Three seven zero seven.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: That's it.\ncaller: I'm the compensation investigator in charge of this case, and if you have a note, please write it down.\nreceiver: Can you repeat that?\ncaller: It's for the test.\nreceiver: This is an interrogation.\ncaller: Okay, well, I'm going to take a look at how you handled the information, and if there's anything missing, I'll fill in the blanks, so let's talk briefly about the incident.\nreceiver: I didn't get a chance to talk about it very quickly, and I was told that one of the parties, one of them had worked at the National Bank for 10 years and had worked for 10 years, and he was my manager, so he created the National Bank Consortium and laundered money, 20 million won or 30 million won for the National Bank, and then 8 million won with the Consortium, and I heard that.\ncaller: You certainly don't know the details.\nreceiver: The investigator said so and so.\ncaller: The National Bank's balance sheet is 36 million won, the Concentration Bank's is 8.7 million won, you need to know exactly.\nreceiver: The population is 36 million.\ncaller: Wait a minute. 8.7 million won. Where are you getting calls from right now? I got a note that you're getting calls from the hostel.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: I'll give you a little bit more detail. In the process of arresting the members of the Kim gang, we found their personal information and a large number of their credit cards. Six out of ten of them have now been searched, but four of the other accomplices are currently on the run. The important thing here is that four of the fugitives have USBs with their personal information, you know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, I'm going to briefly explain to you why this account was opened without your identification, because I don't think you're going to understand it in common sense. Once Kim Jong-un's government was investigating and investigating, it was possible to manipulate or duplicate it because the Oden factions were composed of people who had been investigated by the financial authorities in the past and are currently investigating.\nreceiver: I don't know anything about the law, so I guess I just kind of know what happened.\ncaller: First of all, I got a parcel delivered to the investigator -- let me check it out -- and now there's a pay stub, a savings account, a loan, a promissory note, something like this -- a trust account, this doesn't have anything like this in it -- you don't use it?\nreceiver: I haven't written it lately, but on a military service card, my mother probably just wrote it as a point, she didn't write it in an envelope, and she probably never wrote it, because I never wrote it.\ncaller: Your company has two deposits, two withdrawals, 40 deposits, that's a lot.\nreceiver: Yes, I've given away too much on purpose.\ncaller: Okay, first of all, have you ever heard of tracking an account through a matchmaker?\nreceiver: No, I've never heard of that.\ncaller: We're going to use the same evidence as we did in this recording investigation, and that's how we're now going to do the account tracing, which is the process of verifying whether or not you've received monetary compensation from members of the Kim Jong-un regime. Once you say you're ignorant, in a court of law or in a trial, we like to leave something behind as evidence.\nreceiver: But there's one more thing besides this receipt.\ncaller: What is it?\nreceiver: You don't get paid, you just walk right in.\ncaller: What are you talking about?\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}

I mean, I've never really given them an envelope of money or a gift certificate, as they say in the news, but I've made something, or I've given them something to eat, or something like that, and I think the teachers liked it.\ncaller: My groom always gives me gifts for anniversaries and birthdays and special occasions, and he always gives them in cash, and I want flowers and other things and I want gifts, but he always gives me cash, and he's always asking me for cash on his own birthday and on special days, and he has always told me that it's his favorite gift.\nreceiver: It's nice to get presents, and I've enjoyed them all my life, but it's not so much that they're rare, it's that I've missed them because I didn't really need them. My nephews give me presents, and sometimes when I get them for my birthday, they give me makeup for my eyes. Not only do I don't usually wear makeup, but when I do, I put eyelashes and lipstick on my lips, and when I got the lipstick, I liked it, and she gave me an ice cream cone with a lot of pearls in it, and the color was so pretty, but I hadn't much to do, so I missed it. I still use it now, but I keep it, and I wanted to get an open car, but if you get a gift that big, you want something small.\ncaller: One of the gifts I'd like to receive is a letter written by our babies, and if the babies are a little bit older, I'm going to give them a dishwasher, and I really want to get that gift, and I want to get a letter from the groom, about three pages long, and he says he's always with me, and it's like a letter, at least a very short card, and I've never given him a very long letter, so I would like to get a long letter from him, and I would also like to see the little letters he writes, and the way our kids do the dishes, and then I'd rather have some of his cooking, which I don't do very often, so I think it's a good idea for me to cook one of these little gifts.\nreceiver: When I got married, my in-laws had gifts and clothes from my mother-in-law, and my husband liked the shoes that he had received during our courtship. I think we all get gifts and dresses at weddings, so it's kind of a formality, but I don't know how many times I've gotten gifts from my husband while we were courting, so I remember the shoes that I got at that time, because when we got married, I didn't have any gifts that my husband specifically called wedding gifts.\ncaller: Well, one of the things that I recently made and gave away was a cup holder, a wooden porcelain cup holder, and I had to make it by putting names on it and writing words on it, and a friend of mine opened a consultancy and picked out a gift that would go well with it, and I thought I'd have to make it myself, so I picked out the wood for the cup holder and the words and the lettering and this and that, and I made it myself, and the gentleman who gave the gift also made the cup holder for us to use in our home, and he put the names of the children in it, and the names of their families, and the words were good, and he made the wooden cup holder for other friends who got the gift, and it felt good, and thank you, and I actually heard about it, and it made me feel better, and it was so beautiful and it was written so well, and I think it's still the most memorable gift I've ever made.\nreceiver: I remember when I was in elementary school, there was a class in my mother's class where they made handmade soap and shampoo and cosmetics, and I've heard that for a long time, and I remember making soap and giving it to people, and soap comes in all shapes and forms, and you can put whatever ingredients you want in it, you can shape it and make it in all sorts of different ways, and then I gave it to a little kid's teacher, and I gave it as a gift to a lot of people, and I kept some of the soap that I made, and I wished I had used it later, and when I made it, I was busy showing off my shampoo and makeup and soap, and I was giving it all away to other people.\ncaller: I think it's nice to give a small gift to a friend, and I think it should be less than $100,000, so that we can give each other a lot more often, and it shouldn't be too much of a burden.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

She loves Gandhaniel more than my son, and from time to time, her phone and the backdrop of the press are Gandhaniel's. I didn't know who she was, so I made her have a strange hair color, and she wore a strange suit, and I asked her who she was. She said, \"Gandhaniel is the mother's ideal\". You should know that. Didn't your son say he was an ideal? No, it's not true.\nreceiver: Oh, I'm a real, real fan, not totally, just watching a movie or just being on TV, that's how much I like to listen to music.\ncaller: I've seen it because my mother says it's perfect, and I've watched it on TV and YouTube, and she's like, \"Oh, perfect, well, I'm going to support you all the way, so I think we're doing it with this kind of a little bit of a rebellious feeling that says, 'Find your ideal and go away.'\nreceiver: When I told my friends that I liked Gandaniel, that my aunt liked him, that my teacher liked him, they would tell me things like that, and I'd get a little bit nervous every time.\ncaller: Oh, and for those of you with a little bit of acumen,\nreceiver: But I think I'm good enough, because that's the way I hear it.\ncaller: If you think you're tall because you have actors who are a little bit taller than you, then yes, I'm not exactly an idealist, and I don't watch a lot of TV, and I know that celebrities are just names of some of the actors in my favorite movies, so I am not an idealist because my favorite actors are all men, and the actors I admire are all men and the movies I like are all men with a little bit of a manic tendency, and I think the only woman I would call an idealist is someone who's never been on TV for more than a decade.\nreceiver: Well, you said the outside is bigger than the inside, so what about the outside?\ncaller: I've met a lot of guys who aren't short-haired, but I've seen them smile, and they look a little bit nice, and they have a little bit of a bad personality, but if they're good at laughing, they look good, and I think that's what I'm saying.\nreceiver: I've never traveled abroad with my boyfriend, so I'd like to go on a trip to Europe with him.\ncaller: The reason I mentioned Europe is because\nreceiver: I've heard it said before, that we should go on a trip to Europe together, but we couldn't take it apart.\ncaller: I've heard that when he travels to Europe, he breaks up with her because the Europeans are pretty, they're charming, and I've traveled to this part of Holland, southeastern Europe, and my girlfriend and I have been to Southeast Asia and Japan, so it's not like we've ever had a fight because we've looked at people who look exactly like each other, but I think the guys who have traveled in Europe have looked at each other, and the European women have fallen in love with the European men, and the guy is good-looking, and the girl is beautiful, and that's how they fight, so I thought, if you're going abroad with your boyfriend, why don't you go with someone who looks a little bit like us, who lives in East Asia?\nreceiver: Have a romantic dating course.\ncaller: I have to have all my toys at home, I have to do everything at home, and I love cooking, so I don't have to make them, but even if I can't make them, we can still have a meal together, we can cook meat together, and we can put a video game on the TV together, and play games together, and watch each other flirt, and sleep together until we're not tired anymore, and then we can go to work or something like that, and I've never been worried about it, like that, with the air conditioning on, and then on the same day, in the summer weather, we can talk to each other, and I think that's the ideal date.\nreceiver: It's so comfortable and nice, especially on a hot day, a hot day or a very cold day, when the house is at its warmest and coolest, so...\ncaller: It's 100 times better than traveling abroad.\nreceiver: I think it's a little bit, because there are so many memories of traveling abroad, and it's nice and comfortable to be at home, but it's less memorable than traveling.\ncaller: You said it's a memory, and honestly, when you think about memories in a date or something like that, you have more memories of a small place than where you went or what you did. For example, if you think you went on a trip to Japan with your boyfriend, instead of remembering that you went to Japan, you'd rather go to Japan and think about the delicious food and take pictures of it, so instead of doing that, you might think that it would be a good memory to go to Japan to think about that delicious food, and find a nice house and take photos of it. I'm not trying to avoid traveling abroad, but I think that traveling overseas is not a good way to start a relationship, because if you don't have a deep relationship or a long relationship, you're going to get into a fight.\nreceiver: But it's so colorful overseas, and just to think about it, it's kind of creepy and stuff, and when you're with someone who likes that kind of thing, I think that's pretty meaningful in itself.\ncaller: I'm all for foreign travel dates, but I think it's too risky if you don't want to leave a lot of good memories behind. Even if you fight at home, you can't really get away from home, and you end up staying in a hotel, so you have a lot of time to think about each other, and when you go abroad and you have a fight, it gets deeper, and it's hard to get back together.\nreceiver: Somewhere in Southeast Asia.\ncaller: I've been to India and Japan, and then I went to Japan and then I came back to Korea, and I took a cruise ship to India, and I traveled like this again, and it was fine until I got to Japan, it was fine for two or three days, but when I got to Korea, I packed my bags quickly, and I'm on my way to India for the same day, which is fine for me, because at first it's mysterious, and it's just creepy, and the culture is all these things, and I liked India a little bit, but I don't like India very much, because there are a lot of ideas about aquatic life that don't agree with us, and my girlfriends, and that was creepy at first, but I think it became a burden, so I said, \"Well, don't you think you're being rude, because I'm beautiful, and fantastic, and I came here for such beautiful memories, and I haven't seen anything like this before?\"\nreceiver: I wonder if they picked the wrong country, or if India itself is a little bit different, or if the environment itself is just a little bit more sensitive to each other, and that's why they're fighting.\ncaller: I'd just like to say that I listened to her opinion, she picked out the itinerary, and I paid for it, and I'm not guilty, Your Honor, and that's how we ended up dating and dating, and then I thought, well, there's a little bit of a separation between the ideal and the person you're supposed to marry, because I think the ideal is the ideal, and even if you want to marry the ideal, you can't marry without this part of the marriage.\nreceiver: I think the most important thing is caring, caring, respect, and having the conversation that I was talking about earlier when I was being idealistic, and that's the three things that I think are the most important if you want to be together for a long time.\ncaller: But you said that you need to have a good conversation, and I wanted to ask you this if I ever had the chance to talk to a woman, because it's not the same thing when a man says he has a good conversation and a woman says she has a good dialogue with him, because a man has to be able to go back and forth and tickle each other all the time, and a woman has to be a little bit more accepting and accepting and understanding of herself.\nreceiver: For me, it's kind of a middle ground, and I don't think it's a conversation because I'm just listening to what I'm saying, and we're talking to each other, and this is how it's supposed to be, but basically, if you're a good listener, you feel like you're having a good conversation.\ncaller: We need to talk.\nreceiver: That's how it feels at first.\ncaller: You got it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Usually, when we live in our neighborhood, something small costs 16,000 to 18,000 won, and if you make it look nice and decorate it, it's close to 100,000 units, so you have to do it like that, and you hear this kind of thing, but now I see how it looks good to eat, now it's nice to be pretty, and it's really tasty, but it's not, so I think it's a return, and I usually like to put a good image on Epsom so much, so young people enjoyed taking pictures and uploading it, and that's what the bakery company has to do now to make a little bit of money up there because it's going to be a lot of development, and now there are a lot of these kinds of prices.\ncaller: I don't buy cakes very often, so I didn't know much about the price, but now that I've seen the news and this kind of mascom, and I'm aware of all the different ways in which it's going to be priced down, because of the ingredients and all kinds of things, I think it's gonna be a little bit too expensive, but if it goes up so high, it's probably going to be a little too commercially viable.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm also a bit overpriced, so it's okay to pick up something for an anniversary once in a while, but I think it's a bit of a burden to do it every time, and maybe you can just be comfortable with one or two or three thousand units, and these days they come out really baby-shaped and small, and, well, it's your choice, but that's going to be popular, and I wish it was a price that you could reach this comfortably, and there's also ice cream cakes these days, and so sometimes you make something yourself, but it's just a little bit tedious to make, and the chances of failure are a little bit higher, so I'm a little bit more inclined to live, because it's nice to be a giant, and the price is good, and I'd like the price to be a little bit cheaper.\ncaller: I'm going to compare them in terms of price, one, two, three places, and I think that's a given now that consumers like us are choosing to look at synthetic prices or different qualities or things like that, and that's certainly what consumers are entitled to right now, but it's psychological satisfaction, and it's something that we're going to be able to compare as the industry becomes a little bit more diverse.\nreceiver: Well, when it's their birthday, they basically just do it, and then at Christmas or whatever, there's a time when they want to have a cake like this, and then it's convenient for them to go to a place like Parry Bagatelle or something like that, and buy it once in a while, and now the ice-cream is bought once in a row, and they like to buy it this way, and they don't like it because there's too much cream in the regular cake, so they buy the cheesecake this way and they eat it this way and sometimes the fruit is topped like this, so they eat it with a strawberry sauce on the side, and sometimes the meatballs and potatoes are topped this way, but it's nice because it's not too hot, and it's soft, and then they like it to be decorated with something like chocolate, so it's a little bit too much chocolate on the side.\ncaller: I'm not a regular customer anymore, so I don't really think about what kind of cake I'm going to eat, but I think the ice cream cake is delicious, because it's made by a company called Vaskin Ravins, and it's easy to eat, and it doesn't cut very well, and that's why I think the younger generation is going to like it especially, because it has a little bit of the ice cream in it, and now it's cake-shaped, so it's ice cream-fresh, and it hasn't got that much flavor, and if you like it, you'll like it, but I'd like to buy it and eat it a lot.\nreceiver: Well, the most popular place to go is Parry Bagatelle, and sometimes it's just convenient to buy it in the neighborhood, and sometimes you can buy an ice cream cake like this once in a while in Baskin Ravines in Paris, and the kids sometimes like it to have cream, and sometimes they ask for a cheese cake like this, so we go to Parry bagatelle a lot, and the reason we go there a lot is because there's a little discount on the membership card, so we can use it, and it's tasty, and it can't be consumed right away, and when it's not in stock, it doesn't feel fresh, so we don't go to Baskin Bagatelle very often.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

The artificial highball is literally, literally, the ball with the strongest grip, and the midball is artificial, and the intermediate level of the entry ball is the one with the least grip.\ncaller: Well, highball, well, if you're going to use this, it's going to be a lot more adaptable than what I've got right now, so maybe it's not highball.\nreceiver: I know it's not highball now, but when I saw it, it was mid-ball, and then you bought it and you didn't oil it once, and you've been using it for almost two years now, or about two years, so obviously the ball doesn't have to have motion, and you don't do any of those basic things like oil-draining or whatever, and obviously the points don't come out because you're not doing this or that at all, and so what you said at the beginning is, at this point in time, buying a ball is the best way I've seen to get your brother more interested in bowling, and I think that.\ncaller: I'm just asking, if you're going to change it this time, of course, but if you'd like to just throw it away, and I didn't know that the maintenance guy would have to take out the oil or something, or how many times do you have to do it?\nreceiver: Well, if you buy a new bowl now almost now, because the existing bowl is hardly used, it is possible to dispose of it in the shop or something, and then the need for the care of the bowl, oh brother, how long can you use one bowl, if you don't take care of it, the bowl will die soon, so of course the maintenance is needed, but you haven't seen the maintenance yet, so this time I'll see it, oh x, the old brother didn't take such care, but the bowl of course, now that I've looked at the maintenance, I would like to know how much the bowl is maintained again, but once I saw it, I think the most important thing is to buy the bowl first.\ncaller: I don't know if it's funny, but it's Sunday night, so when I go, there's a parking lot in the apartment, and there's no place to park, so I think I hate going, and it's the same thing, and if you go with that name one guy, it's good, because it's not right again, I think it's better if you come with me, because that makes me want to go a little bit.\nreceiver: The funny part is, I honestly don't feel like it's that much fun these days, but in a way, I think it's an obligation, so I don't miss as much as I can, and I'm trying to attend, but in order to have this fun, you have to keep bowling as much as you can, and if the scores come out well, it'll definitely be more fun, and one more thing is that you write, you always say something, you're just a brother, and not only a brother, but you see how all the single men talk about it, the problem is that there are no women in our club, and if there is a woman, then I think she's the one anyway, because she's in the mood to play games, of course, it's better, and anyway, because of the fact that she's a woman, maybe more men will be able to participate.\ncaller: Oh, you're just saying that because you don't know now. Oh, of course, now that I've changed, I'll call you the same way and say that there's no problem with corona or something, but it's a little bit of a lie, but oh, at some point I got a little sick.\nreceiver: I don't think there's a lot to say about bowling these days, but I've seen him do a lot of high-end sports that I don' t do, like golf and golf and then scuba, and honestly, I'd like to do all of those things, but I can't hang out with him because it doesn' t seem to be worth the expense, but I just want to know what the attractions of this sport are.\ncaller: To be honest with you, I've always wanted to learn about scuba diving, so I've been wanting to learn about it for a long time, and now I'm doing it, so once I was educated in Guangzhou, that's the reason, and then I went abroad to Europe, and I tried it, but I'm sure there's a scuba dive, and it feels like this is another world, and now it's in the water, and I'm free to move around there, and it's something that people think is scary, but I don't think it's so bad, I just take it once in a while, and it tastes like water, but now I can see it on the beach, but honestly, if I'm going to do scuba divings in Korea, I can't see it because it's not fun, it's fun, and now there's another attraction, and these people who have done a lot of scuba dives, they're going to take it inside, and they'll eat it, and it will taste good, and then they'll have a few drinks\nreceiver: Well, I've had some experience with scuba diving, and I've never been to the real world of the ocean, but I'd like to do it, because there are other worlds that people don't know if they haven't been to them, but I think this is an expensive sport, and I think it's an expensive sport.\ncaller: Well, this scooter said at the beginning that if you buy equipment, it breaks without any money, and I honestly don't have any equipment, so I have some glasses and some swimsuits, and I haven't prepared yet because I don't know if I'm going to do this consistently, of course I've done it consistently, I've been out once, and I've just left it somewhere in Korea, and I broke $2,300,000 last time.\nreceiver: Well, I'm not a big brother, but I do a lot of sports, so I'm just wondering if there's something you'd like to try later.\ncaller: And now that I'm a little bit older, little by little, I've got to finish it, because at first I didn't want to do it anymore, but now I do.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

It's really bad once it's frozen.\ncaller: But the show hosts say that if you freeze it, take it out and eat it, it tastes the same.\nreceiver: They're just saying it's the same even though it's similar.\ncaller: Then I guess we'll have to think about how to store it.\nreceiver: It's not like it's been out for a day or two, it's got to taste bad because of the way it's stored, there's no way to store it well, and that's why, anyway, we need some kind of system so that we can consume what we produce as soon as possible, and it's very difficult.\ncaller: Production is up, but consumption is down because of the coronavirus, and exports are down, so we're just going to have to freeze everything that's been produced.\nreceiver: Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry. There's no other way.\ncaller: So why don't we just lower the price a little bit more and get consumers to buy more?\nreceiver: Right, so I'm going to go out of my way to buy some yarn and see if there's a way to make it cheaper for the consumer.\ncaller: The price is down from last year by about 40,000 yuan, but it's still expensive to buy directly, and the cost of the uniforms for the villagers to eat is still the same.\nreceiver: You're expensive, so you don't get to eat a lot.\ncaller: If you don't trade directly, you go through almost four or five stages to get to the consumer, and from there the margin stays, and the producers don't make much profit, but the consumers have to buy at several times that price, so I think it's a really bad structure.\nreceiver: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on, but the idea is really simple, and everybody's thinking about it, and they're going to run their own business, and if you're standing in front of a fish that's now being sold in bulk, and you're just going to sell it in bulk and eat it, you'll buy it there and eat it. It's not easy to eat it, and it's a little bit expensive, but it's kind of a separate thing to sell that kind of stuff in bulk now, and then the fish producers bring the fish there themselves, and it gets so fragmented, and they come to the farmers' market, and they go to the local farmers' markets, and they buy it in the market, and then they buy it there in the restaurants, because it's going to be a little bit more expensive to get into the fish, and it doesn't sell well in the markets, and then it's not going to be cheap to buy it in large quantities, and you can't consume it, so if you can get it into the general household, how do you think the price will\ncaller: Well, I don't know if it makes a big difference whether it's frozen or melted, but since the big corporations are using it through the chain stores, they'll probably buy it cheaply and in bulk, and the common people won't be able to eat it all at once, but it tastes best when it's sliced up and dipped in seaweed salt.\nreceiver: Yeah, depending on how you cook it, there's something like that, the turtledove, yeah, the one you mentioned earlier, uh, that was really delicious, but the whole thing was cooked like this, or the other one, uh, I don't know how to cook it, but I like the turtles from the company best, yeah, I'd like to develop a little bit of that.\ncaller: You like instant, but yesterday I was standing in front of the apartment, and a guest bought ten jumpsuits, and he asked the boss to take out all the jumpsuit shit, so the boss said, \"Why don't you take that delicious jumpsuit shit?\"\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Is it right that I'm paying as much interest as I'm spending?\ncaller: Ah, so what's the upper limit? It's 200,000,000 over 200 million, right? Does it vary depending on income and credit?\ncaller: So does the loan plus the interest plus the loan amount also depend on my credit?\ncaller: Is it going to be a one-year/one-year contract?\nreceiver: So it's one year over one year.\ncaller: Can I apply for an extension before it expires?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: If I apply for an extension, do I extend it in units of 1 year over 1 year?\nreceiver: So this is a unit extension.\ncaller: Do you have any collateral to pay back if you cancel your loan in the meantime?\nreceiver: There is no severance package.\ncaller: Thank you for your confirmation.

I have a lot of friends who have been married since they were kids, and they're very, very well off, and the baby's growing up beautifully, and even if they fight, they can get past each other, and they can get over each other.\nreceiver: I've never really thought about it, but if you have a favorite person, you're going to fit in with that person, and I don't think there's any difference, because if you think about it this way, the person you meet is going to end up being my ideal, and I haven't really thought much about it, and I think a couple of kids would be appropriate.\ncaller: I'm very cautious about having a baby, and I think you should have a baby at least once, but I think it's best to wait until the surgery or the second one.\nreceiver: I think there are a lot of parents who don't have children these days, and the cost of raising a child is a lot, and I'm thinking about one or two at the most, but I think that if I have the ability, and I can raise more children, and I have the capacity to raise more kids, I think I can raise not one, not two, but three.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

In Brazil today, China is buying Brazil, and that's the reaction that we're seeing in the United States right now. What do you think about that?\ncaller: It seems to me that Brazil now has cheap labor, and it doesn't seem to have the technology to create that industry, but Chinese capital is coming in, and they're setting up factories in China, and they are hiring local workers, and then they're outsourcing, and the Brazilian people don't think about what they're getting out of it, and they think that China is locking up Brazilian capital in China, so it looks like they're trying to outsource Chinese capital, and it looks like Brazil is trying to build its own economy, and the newly elected president of Brazil is saying things like Trump. What do you think about this? Do you think this was an electoral strategy?\nreceiver: You said that the president-elect in Brazil right now is saying the same thing as Trump in the U.S. He's saying these two summits are going to improve people's lives and work together, and he's saying good things about breaking the vicious cycle of rising debt and adding a little bit more of privatization to the current private sector, and you can say things like this, but on the other hand, I think it's also true that Brazil's position is getting much smaller now that we're selling Brazilian capital to China and now to other countries, and the New York Times is now saying that the elected leader in South America is a very extreme leader, what do you think about that?\ncaller: I don't think the president-elect of Brazil is an extremist leader, and I think the president who was in power in the left-wing regime before that, under that regime, there were a lot of complaints from the general public about security issues, about the finances of the welfare state, and to speak for the people who were complaining, I think he said these words, because the crime rate was so high during this period of left-wing rule in Brazil, what do you think is the reason?\nreceiver: In Brazil right now, there's a lot of crime in the country, and there's security issues, and there is the death penalty for violent criminals, and so on, and I think it's because the politicians who were there before, to give each other their boats, they neglected the economy, neglected security, and by doing politics in that way, it seems that Brazil has had a bad security until now, and this time the Brazilian politician who won the election tells us in the electoral court that the voter turnout was 55 percent, or that he won the vote.\ncaller: The fact that the voter turnout was 55 percent, I think it was a contest between this leftist regime and the previous leftist regime, and I think we were elected with the support of some of those far-right voters, because of that small difference, and we had security cameras in the previous left-wing regime, which did not improve the national finances, so why do you think the leftist regime had such security cameras?\nreceiver: Now in Brazil, in the process of pouring the national budget into welfare policies like Boussa Família e Fomízero, and saying that the infrastructure has not been developed, and the economic situation of the leftist regime is very bad, and the debt is rising, and we're going to break the vicious circle, and it seems to be getting very bad, even though the candidate who was elected in Brazil during the election period was attacked by the mob and didn't have a proper electoral process, what do you think about this?\ncaller: It seems to me that it's not a bad thing, it's a good thing, that this monster's retreat was not an evil thing, but that in the midst of all this, campaigning and showing the face of a politician who is a little bit stronger, it seems to have increased the voter turnout of the newly elected president of Brazil, whose policy is to oppose President Trump in the United States, do you think that now in some ways he has similarities with President Trump?\nreceiver: I think it's the Brazilian president-elect and the winner and President Trump and President Trump of the United States, and what I think about this is that their own political actions, their outspokenness to other members of parliament, or their criticism of outrageous words that can't be put in their mouths, seems to be the same for both presidents. The current winner in Brazil says he's going to change the destiny of Brazil, and he'll reform Brazil a lot in the future, and he says, \"What do you think about that?\"\ncaller: I think all the politicians are saying the same thing, they're just saying it and not doing it, and this newly elected president of Brazil is going to do something about it, whether it's going to boost the economy or not, and so on, and I think we'll have to wait until he's president to see whether or not he'll follow through on that promise.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

Can you tell me your favorite season and why?\ncaller: I think my favorite season is autumn, because it's probably spring and autumn, when it's not too cold or too hot, but it's just the right temperature and the right breeze, and I think I like autumn better than spring, because spring is kind of charismatic, and it's kind of warm and bright, and I don't really fit in with spring, so I think I'm a little bit more of a down-to-earth kind of person, and I like a little bit of a toned-down vibe and color in autumn, and, as the saying goes, spring and fall are kind of similar, but I think autumn is something that's cooler and more attractive, but lately it seems to be fading away, and I'm really sorry, and that's why I've been enjoying it a lot these days, when there's this kind of autumnal weather, and I guess you could tell me what your favorite season is.\nreceiver: Yeah, I like autumn a lot more than spring, and I know that most women like spring a lot more, and oh, spring or summer a little more sunny, but of course not all of them, but oh, but I've always had a favorite season since I was a kid, and it's always autumn, and the wind in autumn is not heavy, and there's always some light wind that makes me feel like I can go anywhere on two feet, and the colorful flowers are beautiful, but somehow I feel bored, and this season of autumn feels a little more attractive, and I don't think it's because it's autumn that it's not colorful, but if you ask me about autumn styles, I think where do I want to go in autumn to feel a little bit more beautiful and pretty?\ncaller: I think you're really good with autumn, which is where I'd like to go in the fall. Well, I haven't really traveled much, so I don't really know where I'm going, but I think you mentioned the blizzard, and I think it would be great if there was a place where you could see the blizzards, just as there are a lot of things related to the cherry blossom festival in the spring, but they're just as brief in the fall, but there's a lot of places where you can enjoy the blistering blizzards.\nreceiver: If you want to go in the autumn, or if you like it, I would like to recommend our estate in the country, which is famous for the autumn breeze. It's not every year, but it's strange that at this time of the autumn I always go abroad and I've been to the estate once. I think it's a really beautiful place with the wind and the breeze, especially in the countryside.\ncaller: Strangely enough, I think winter is the next best thing to autumn, because it's a little bit different, but one of the reasons why winter is better than summer is that when it gets hot in the summer, you can't take your clothes off, and you really can't do this or that, but when it's warm in the winter, you can actually feel a little bit of the cold wind, and I'm a little bit dehydrated, so I think it looks a little bit cooler to wear thick clothes, but now that I'm all grown up, I always feel that snow is just a little bit logical and uncomfortable, but even as a kid, I've always wanted to go outside and dig in the snow, and in fact I've been there a lot, but I've never been to a ski resort, so I'd rather eat snow cones or go skiing, or maybe it's the most fun ice skating I've ever done, or maybe there's a lot of other things you can do to enjoy the winter.\nreceiver: Strangely enough, I think it's summer, because summer is so hot, and I tend to prefer the warm, sunny spring, but for some reason, I don't feel so attracted to spring, and I think I'd rather it be warm, like summer, because spring is kind of blurry, and I get a lot of sleep, and I feel like, well, something about summer makes me more active in spite of the heat, and that's why I tend to live a little bit healthier.\ncaller: I don't think it's easy to tell which is better, spring or summer, because spring is generally thought of as the season when something starts and it's the season of flowering, and that gives me a lot of positive feelings, and I actually think there's a lot of charm in summer, and I've talked about it before, but I think there are a lot of special things that you can do in summer.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

help you do it on the day by using an indirect method, so you have to understand it accurately, first of all, if you're a customer, it'll be easy for you to think about it.\ncaller: Now that you know how it normally goes up, you'll soon understand how it goes up in a peripheral way.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, the way that this would normally go up in credit scores is if you were to take, for example, a loan from a financial institution, and the term of the contract is three years, because the loan is set.\ncaller: If you pay off your debt within the three-year period, and then it normally expires and you have to pay it back, your credit score will go up.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yes, but you don't have to complete your evaluation in one day.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So we need a bypass, and the most obvious bypass is forced redemption.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The normal use of forced redemption is when you have a financial dispute, or you have a problem after you get a loan, and you want to go to the lender and claim it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: When you ask them to solve a problem like that, financial firms often ignore it, but can't customers see the harm in that now?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So now the Banking Association, on top of the finance company, on the side of the banking association, which manages the banks, receives those claims, those inconveniences, and this is the customer, and when that inconvenience is resolved, this is the cash refund, and this was borrowed from the lending company, and I must have gotten it wrong, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So this is a forced redemption, which is a way for you to process your refund without any interest or mid-term redemption fees or any credit disadvantages, and we can help you by applying this.\ncaller: When you get a loan from the fastest financial institution you can get, you don't just use your loan amount, you put it on your bank balance sheet on the same day.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: He's already a client of ours in the SADC, and he's trying to get this loan on our side, but the other side is in too much of a hurry to get the money, and the other side got the loan wrong, so he's going to ask for authorization to do the compulsory reimbursement now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then, if you don't get a permit, the agent can be assigned.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And now we're going to use that agent to force reimbursement.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: It's not like his credit rating is gonna go up just because he's handling forced returns.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: When you're dealing with a forced redemption, you're doing it in the form of an invoice, so you borrow today and you pay today, but in terms of the invoice, your credit score is going to go up, so you're going to use the entire three-year term of a normal loan agreement, and you're just going to fill out the paperwork and register it on the invoice.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And that's going to raise your credit rating, and that's how we're going to be able to give you a loan if there's a collateral issue.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is there anything you don't understand about what I'm saying?\nreceiver: I don't have one, but it's a complicated procedure.\ncaller: It's a complicated process, but just to give you an idea, because you don't have a credit rating right now, you can borrow money from somewhere else and pay it back on the same day, but you're only going to get one in the middle because your credit rating is going up.\nreceiver: No, but then you'd have to have 10 million dollars in cash to get a temporary refund.\ncaller: I'm not asking you to repay a loan that you already have.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So if you take out a loan somewhere else and you pay it back, you don't have a financial burden, right?\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Yes, and that's going to help the person in charge make progress.\nreceiver: Yes, yes, I see what you mean.\ncaller: First of all, if you can't get a loan anywhere else, you might have to do the same thing that you're doing now, because in your case, there's no big credit problem, and there's a part of our agreement where you can get a loan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So this loan right now is a little bit short, so you have to replenish it, but once you get the loan, there's no big problem because you're barely 54 years old.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So you're going to be able to get loans from other places, so you can go ahead and talk to the people who are in charge.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yes, I understand.

You've arrested criminals in this case, but we're still investigating whether there were additional accomplices of criminals and even the involvement of bankers. Now among those involved in this case there are additional secondary and thirdary victims who have been extortionated, not only deposits that are managed online without your knowledge, but also money transferred or withdrawn using this information that has been hacked online. Account tracking on these parts... When we investigate and confirm the identity of the victim of the theft of personal data, there will be a protection investigation? The protection investigation will be carried out when the victim's identity has been verified. The protection investigation is going to be carried out before the person's identity is confirmed, and I'm going to tell you that there are a lot of secondary and tertiary victims exposed, so not only the financial business is being verified online, but also the real-time monitoring of the customer's financial accounts. If you hear that all the people involved in this process are being prosecut\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you have to pay in and out on time?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: So if you're uncomfortable with your life because of that part of it, right? The Depository Protection Act, and then we're going to set it up for you, and I'll set it up, but this part of it is that the bank accounts that are set up under the depository protection act can be used, of course, during the investigation period, but if you can, for example, in a bank account that has a depository protection law, so you don't have an account that you have to use to make a profit right now.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: And if, for example, we find in that account, as a result of our investigation, that there's an illegal flow of funds or an illegal increase in wealth, you're going to be severely punished, and that's something that you have to consider, and we'll set up a deposit protection policy for those bank notes that you use very honestly and urgently.\nreceiver: What is this, 2015?\ncaller: How are you?\nreceiver: What's that 2015 you called me about?\ncaller: Sir, here's the case file from the investigation.\nreceiver: What's 2015? Can you give me a call?\ncaller: The investigation.\nreceiver: I mean...\ncaller: Zero six six eight.\nreceiver: What's your last name?\ncaller: What's my name? I told you earlier, I'm a sergeant major.\nreceiver: Are you with the Seoul Police Department now?\ncaller: This is the Seoul Police Department's Criminal Investigation Team.\nreceiver: What's your phone number?\ncaller: If you'd like to come in, our phone number is Seoul 02.\ncaller: It's 6:01 p.m. and it's 6017.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}

Thank you for letting me know.\ncaller: And one last thing, because this is $99 right now, that's how much lower the limit is, when is the limit going to be?\ncaller: I'm pretty much done with this cancellation, so if I write a card before it's repaired, it might not get approved.\ncaller: It may take another two or three days after the cancellation, but we'll wait until it's fully recovered.\ncaller: However, in the future, when you pay on an overseas site, even if there are only two approvals due to an error, it's not necessarily charged in full, but you have to buy it from the credit card company, because it's a request, and I told you to check it.\ncaller: If you buy one, you're only charged for one.\ncaller: I went to the National Card app to cancel, but I didn't see any cancellation, so I called and said, \"I have to call the customer service center, but do they receive it, or I can't find it in the app, and it's not available yet?\"\ncaller: If something like this happens in the future, I'm going to have to call and cancel it immediately, because the waiting time is too long and it's too uncomfortable every time I call.

Can all bank housing clearances be equally available a year later?\ncaller: I'm just wondering, if you don't have a steady income, is there a way to borrow against the balance?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Is there a way to borrow money out of the money that you've deposited?\nreceiver: It's up to 90% of your down payment.\ncaller: Is there any chance that collateral loans will affect your credit rating?\nreceiver: It doesn't affect your credit rating.\ncaller: Oh, thank you. There's something called an advance payment. What is that?\nreceiver: If the maturity is less than a month, and the payment is completed by the last turn, then the maturity termination is conditional.\ncaller: Oh, and if I pay the last installment when I have less than a month left, will I get the same interest rate that I originally promised?\ncaller: Oh, thank you. I'll have to figure out the amount first. I can't do it right now.\nreceiver: Yes, is there anything else I can help you with?\ncaller: No, thank you.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.

Can I help you?\ncaller: Hi, I've been depositing a year's worth of regular deposits in a shared bank, and I'm trying to get rid of it because I need the money urgently, so I called to ask how to do it, but you have to go to the bank to do it and then you can't do it online.\nreceiver: So you can do it online.\ncaller: You can do it online in the Sharing Banking app, and you don't have to install or subscribe to any other app.\ncaller: Then I'll need something for the dismissal. Can I have a receipt?\nreceiver: Please note this.\ncaller: If you're an adult, you need an ID card, if you're a minor, you can't do it online, you have to go to the courthouse with an attorney, and I'm an adult, and if I have an ID card I can do it online or offline.\ncaller: And if the savings account that I'm going to close was opened by visiting the bank, I have to go to the bank and close it.\nreceiver: You can go anywhere.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. And the term deposits can be terminated at any time, regardless of the term, and the principal will be returned to me. Instead, the interest rate is lower than the one that was originally supposed to come back to me when it expired. It's a two-year term deposit, and I put it in for a year, so the interest rate would be 0.7%, and I wouldn't get the money in cash, but I would get it into any account I wanted, including interest.\ncaller: And I've heard that there's a saying that even if you don't get your money right away, you can withdraw it after a few months.\ncaller: And there's a disadvantage to me if I terminate and re-create.\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: You can also withdraw money and make a deposit on the spot.\ncaller: If you're not an adult, but a juvenile, and you have to pay a fine, do you have to be accompanied by an attorney?\nreceiver: Please note this.\ncaller: All right, you'll need a court representative to accompany you, and the court representative will only be required to show proof of identity, whether it's a passport or a residence permit.\ncaller: And when I open a savings account, I can see in the app how much I've put in, how much interest is accruing, what's left over for future payments, how much I can get back when it expires, and I don't have to go to the bank.\ncaller: Yes, and if you're going to open and close your account online, does that have anything to do with the opening hours of the bank? Can't you do it late at night or early in the morning, except during bank checks?\ncaller: So the Sharing Bank is open every day from 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., so if you want to avoid that time, you can do it anytime, and on the second Tuesday of every month, you check in for three hours from 12 am to 3 am, and then you can start at 3 o'clock.\nreceiver: Yes, I understand.

I was heartbroken when I read it, and you read it, too, about how he ended up like this.\nreceiver: Yes, I'm sorry to hear that the owner of that barber shop in the West Village was found guilty of manslaughter by the use of a hammer when I read this article. Oh, good citizen, this barber shop was opened in 2009 and has been doing very well for about seven years, but the law in our country says that after five years, after five years of this initial contract, it will be excluded from protection. This has not yet been passed by the parliament and is still pending. And not only this commercial building rental protection law, but also the other laws, the security reforms to restrict the enforcement of private companies have not yet passed the parliament.\ncaller: I'm looking at this, and we're looking at this case, and it's going to be in the news and in the newspapers, but there's a lot of cases where it's not going to be like this, because if you look at the fish shop, the fish shop owner has sold the shop, and when it doesn't work well, it doesn' t work well, but if you want to make a little money, you have to take the fish shop away, and after a few years the fish shop owners have to give it back to their relatives, and they don' t have to worry about it anymore, so I think it' s a pity that it takes three to five years for them to make some money, and then they start making some money, or they get recognized and become a fisherman, but if they want to be a fisherman already, the owners will start collecting money from the beginning of the month, and they start collecting it, and they'll do it for a year, and then it' s going to happen, but if this is going to be a good fisherman, they'll have to wait a year to get the fish out\nreceiver: Yeah, I've seen a lot of stories about how the owner of this family home in the West Village got away with murder by swinging a hammer, and it really makes me think that something like this really shouldn't have happened. Well, I see a lot of landlords here, and I've heard a little bit about the landlord's mind, and I think it would have been better if we had just given him a little bit more time, raised the rent, gotten a little bit of the monthly payment, and managed to control each other a little bit better, so this kind of extreme and tragic thing would not have happened.\ncaller: Yeah, I've been going to a lot of real estate now when I'm buying a house, and that's how I've done it, but in real estate, you still have to be a little bit more careful, so later on, the landlord, and this is the contract, and you sign it, and you end up like this, so you do this, but when you're signing a house contract, I think it was a little bit simpler and easier, because there's a lot of things that brokers do that way, so we're a little bit far from the law, actually, and the law itself makes it feel a little bit difficult to even hear the words, so I think about these parts of the building, where the owner has this commercial rental car insurance law or this thing, and when we've been working together in a number of commercial buildings, these parts and these difficult parts are not resolved directly, and then things get this emotional between us, and you don't know what's going to happen.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0}

You don't have to get reimbursed by the lender.

So what?\ncaller: If you want me to take care of it properly, I'll take care of the $4 million in credit card balances or the repayment. Yes, I think you know that now. I checked, too, but it was a little difficult to take out a Yogur loan.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: I'll report you to the attorney for reissuing your credit card.\nreceiver: So you're going to have to pay $1.5 million more.\ncaller: All right, so we're just going to re-release what the agent paid for, and then we're going to go to the client's agent, and the agent's in the middle of dealing with some bad debts, and this part is going to be reimbursed to the client.\nreceiver: What are you gonna do when you don't have any money?\ncaller: I'm the least I can do for you, but if you don't, there's nothing we can do about it.\nreceiver: I'll let you call me back later.\ncaller: When can you do yoga? You have to rewrite the paperwork yourself, but you're not going to be punished, and the agent is going to end up with a yoga detention or a promotion within the branch anyway. Now, first of all, you're our client, the client, because the loan is more important. You're the client, and you're going to have to tell me how long you have to have a detention, and you don't have to tell the legal team, I'm in the process of confirming it, or I have to tell you how it's going to be done, because if the attorney asks you directly at the head office, I can't necessarily cover that.\nreceiver: Well, I'll see what I can do.\ncaller: So, I'm going to give you a break until noon, but if you want to talk to me through the yoga department, please contact me directly.\nreceiver: One o'clock at lunch, one and a half?\ncaller: Until 1:30 at lunch, please.\nreceiver: All right, I got it.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\".", "loss": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1}
