Your task is to analyze a conversation log between two parties and determine if it exhibits characteristics of a scam or fraudulent intent.\n\n**Input Format:**\nThe user will provide a conversation text enclosed within <conversation> tags.\n\n**Classification Criteria:**\n- Output 'True': If the conversation contains evidence of scamming, phishing, social engineering, financial fraud, or malicious intent by either party.\n- Output 'False': If the conversation appears to be a normal, benign interaction without fraudulent intent.\n\n**Output Constraints (CRITICAL):**\n1. You must output EXACTLY one word: \"True\" or \"False\".\n2. Do NOT output any explanation, reasoning, preamble, or punctuation.\n3. Do NOT output markdown formatting (e.g., no bold, no code blocks).\n4. Do NOT apologize or converse.\n5.
