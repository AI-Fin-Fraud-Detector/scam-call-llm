This is wrong. Even Japanese people living in Japan know that Japanese history education itself is wrong, but they encourage it and teach lessons to children. Such rumors have been around for decades.\ncaller: I think twentysomethings are a little bit indifferent to history, so if you ask them the most basic questions, they often get the wrong answer, and I wonder if that part of the story really comes from the minds of 20-year-old students, which is why education is often wrong, and I think that no matter how much you think about it, you have to think about it subjectively. I've heard that history once before, that Korean, Chinese, and all Japanese scholars get together with a common denominator and try to judge as objectively as possible and write a history book, so let's teach children about education.\nreceiver: I've been thinking a little bit lately that politicians are a little bit ignorant of their roles in the parliament and do some extra-curricular activities like that. I mean, I don't think that far-right groups are campaigning too little. Activities to oppose the dictatorship of the Moon absolutely, but I can't help but think that the far-right activities of students in Seoul, which is arguably the best university in the country, are really horrifying. Every time I look at those articles, I see that there are not even first graders from each school who think that they are the best students because the best kids have some ideas, some meetings, read some books, were influenced by some senior adults, and so on. It's so sad that they are announcing something like this and so forth.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

And I think, although it's now legally mandated that when you take your pets out, you have to put a leash on them, but when you walk around my house with kids, you often see dogs that are not walking alone, and I'm not opposed to having a pet, but I also have a sense of responsibility for that, because it comes with responsibility, and if you do it right and you take care of it, then I'm more proactive in favor of keeping pets.

We're going to do a voice recording now because of an incident, and I'm going to ask you to answer my question as best you can. Are you the person in question?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you know a 42-year-old man named Izuhiro from Nagano?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: If you're new to this, then you've opened a bank account with Hanana Bank in Kampong Chhnang on September 15th, 2014.\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: In the last two or three years, have you ever lost your wallet, your passport, your I.D., any of these items that contained personal information about you?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: So you're a bank employee that you know personally, and you've said that you've never lost a money order.\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: There wasn't, because as you can see right now, he's not just a fraudster, but he's an ex-bank employee who was working at the bank, and he's being investigated for allegedly collecting and misusing customer information that was stolen or inactive during his time at the school.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Of course, you said that the First Party's accomplices included employees of the Second Bank, the Second Bank and various financial institutions. Didn't you receive a separate communication from the financial institutions that your personal information was leaked?\nreceiver: I don't think there's any money in it. I didn't come here specifically for this.\ncaller: Okay, first of all, if you look at the statements you've made so far, you're saying that you're a victim instead of a victim of identity theft, and if you're right about your identity being stolen, then other victims could be created because there are other ATMs opened in your name in other financial markets that you don't even know about right now.\nreceiver: I have an SCO account, but I'm not doing any trading at the moment.\ncaller: You mean all of these?\nreceiver: No, no, there's no one bank, but there was a Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development, and I know that they probably closed the account.\ncaller: So there's no such thing as a vacation account left.\nSo if you exclude the cooperative and the bank, which banks are you dealing with right now?\ncaller: You've only done one transaction before, so according to your statement, we're going to freeze all of them, except for our bank, and if there are any orders from other financial institutions, we'll freeze them all. And what this freeze means is that you can't make deposits or withdrawals now and then, and the Financial Supervisory Authority has suspended payments now, and it's in the order, and you're saying that you're freezing the order so that no one can use it now.\nreceiver: When will the freeze be lifted?\ncaller: It's not going to work if you freeze it, and that's because you're only using one of our banks right now, and the other banks are verifying it with a large container, so it's not supported when you freeze.\nreceiver: I mean, it's not like it's going to go on forever, you know, for years and years and years.\ncaller: It doesn't matter if you're going to open it after you die, but when you look at the money at this time, for example, our bank excludes our bank and the new bank comes out, we'll exclude our bank and freeze the new bank.\nreceiver: So there's a bank right over there, and then there's other banks.\ncaller: It doesn't matter what account you're using right now.\nreceiver: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Can I open the account? With our bank, with the National Bank, with the Foreign Exchange Bank, with Shinhan Bank, but I'll have to write Shinhan Bank as well.\ncaller: So you're saying that if our people get orders from other financial institutions, other than the foreign exchange limit, I can't unfreeze all the freezing process, and this is now, after four to six months, if there is no record of anyone using this, it will be automatically canceled. First of all, how many accounts have been opened directly by our bank in your name?\nreceiver: Two of them.\ncaller: Do you use it as a regular down payment or a deposit?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is it considered normal if you have a current account balance that's roughly the amount of money that's left over from your last transaction with our bank?\nreceiver: I don't know.

It's possible. I was about to be a big deal.\ncaller: You said you were about to make a big deal out of it, but can you tell us what the circumstances were?\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, I got a weird call this morning saying that there was a glitch in the payment system and that money had been drained from my account.\ncaller: So, how did you get the money from there?\nreceiver: At first, they impersonated the official financial institution, so I had to trust them, because they knew all my account numbers and bank information, and I really did.\ncaller: Do you remember what kind of bank it was?\nreceiver: Yes, it was our bank.\ncaller: So, can you explain specifically how you were able to extract the funds from there?\nreceiver: Yeah, they told me that they needed to urgently move the money to another secure account to stop the account from being used for illegal transactions, so they told me to transfer the money to the account they told me about.\ncaller: Do you remember the account number?\nreceiver: Yeah, it was 987-6543-2101, and I was so nervous that I almost transferred right away.\ncaller: Was there anything unusual about the process?\nreceiver: Well, it was kind of weird that they were so quick to ask for a transfer, and they kept telling me not to hang up, so I kind of stopped and thought about it.\ncaller: Well done.

So the agricultural cooperative is just a ledger, and there's just no money in it, and neither does the bank, and now the bank has just created this, and in the old days, the start-up grant was created to support me, and now I'm not using that anymore, there's no money at all in it.\ncaller: In fact, the overall reason we're contacting you now is to see if you've been paid by a financial crime syndicate to sell tickets, or if your personal information has been leaked and you're now a victim of a financial crime.\nreceiver: So what's the outcome?\ncaller: First of all, because we have to investigate, and as soon as we receive this e-mail, you're going to have some anxiety and discomfort, but on our part, to be honest with you, we've found Mr. Ido Hyun's agent in an illegal location, so we're now going to ask you a few questions to cover up whether you're the perpetrator or the victim. Once that question is answered, we'll proceed with the recording, and the recording will now be submitted to the Financial Crimes Commission, and it will be used as evidence against your victim.\nreceiver: It's a home.\ncaller: Are you alone in your house?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. And then I'm going to start recording.\nreceiver: I don't have to make time for this, do I?\ncaller: First of all, we're going to look at the progress of the investigation, and that's what we'll decide, so first of all, let's start with the recording.\nreceiver: But I have a question: Is this because I'm a young entrepreneur, and I've got a start-up grant, and now I have to support it?\ncaller: You were talking about the Young Entrepreneur Grant?\nreceiver: So I'm applying for a grant from the Intermediate Authority or something, and I'm looking at whether this is a perpetrator or a victim, and that's something that I personally don't want to do.\ncaller: You're setting up a start-up right now?\nreceiver: I just registered my business, but I don't have a loan yet.\ncaller: You probably don't have to worry about that, it's a different part.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I'm not in the financial industry, so I can't give you any specific information.\nreceiver: I'm obviously a victim, but how do I know where my information was leaked from?\ncaller: That's because you're the prosecutor in charge of the case, and I'm the investigator who decides whether we're victims or perpetrators, so if you'll cooperate with me in this investigation, we'll explain it to you later.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: You said you don't know a man named Park Geun-hye from Dongtan, is that true?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You said that you're currently only doing one of these two things:\nreceiver: No, they're both just toll booths -- toll booth -- I mean, there's only one toll booth that's opened in my name, and I haven't used a toll booth in almost, really, really many years.\ncaller: Oh, so you only have two accounts, and they're all human accounts?\nreceiver: I built your synagogue when I was in high school, and I opened it last year, and now I have no money.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: Last year I did the math, and now there's no money.\ncaller: Yes, on August 7, 2014, it was confirmed that a bank account had been opened at the Konkan and Hana banks in the Khotan Iron and Steel Zone.\nreceiver: No, not at all.\ncaller: No, no, no. Now, Mr. Ido Hyun's personal warrant was found at an illegal site, so we had it frozen without his consent. Do you know what a freeze is?\nreceiver: Didn't you put a stop to it?\ncaller: So you have to make a statement about the financial instrument that you have opened yourself, and the reason this is important is that it's necessary in order to freeze, as I said before, any financial instrument or account other than the one that you're declaring now.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So what happens to the name of the financial institution that you've opened for yourself?\nreceiver: The National Bank is like this?\ncaller: Yes, all the other parts, all of them, you have to make a statement, and we're going to use that statement as a basis for our investigation, and when we find the rest of the accounts, we'll ask to have them frozen.\nreceiver: But what if there's something you forgot to say, and it's all frozen?\ncaller: Yes, you can see that. Do you have a lot of bonds that trade a lot?\nreceiver: The corporate bank, the national bank, the syndicate.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: I don't use the narrows, but the narrows... the narrows and then the bank.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: Yeah, I guess that's how it works.\ncaller: If you have an account in a financial institution that you're not currently using, you have to tell the financial institution everything.\nreceiver: And the post office -- there might be a post office, but I don't care if it's frozen if I'm not using it.\ncaller: That doesn't matter. Yeah, so now the five financial zones that we've talked about so far are the one, the cooperative, the people, the corporation, the post office, right?\nreceiver: Can you repeat that?\ncaller: For example, the CIS, the people, the companies, the post office, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, I'm going to ask you to tell me the number of accounts in the five financial institutions that you've described so far.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: How many accounts do you have in the One Bank financial sector right now?\nreceiver: There's one of each.\ncaller: So let's talk about the use of each account for each financial instrument that you've described, so if it's a deposit, it's an deposit, if it is a withdrawal, it is a deposit.\nreceiver: Yeah, and it's been a while since we've used the post office or the synagogue, so maybe it's just been put on hold.\ncaller: The post office and the synagogue are on Human Accounts.\nreceiver: Yeah, I probably would.\ncaller: You haven't made any deposits in any other financial institution.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: The last time you checked your assets in your account, how much would you need to prove that you now own the assets?\nreceiver: How much do you need... all the same?\ncaller: So if you've stated that your deposits at Hanbanki and the National Bank are one million yen each, and we've checked with the Financial Supervisory Commission, what you've said, and the amount of more than one million yen that you're receiving in the event of a disaster is for the purpose of using illicit funds and processing the withdrawal to the National Treasury, how much assets do you have in the deposit account of Hanbanki?\nreceiver: I'm not spending it right now, so I don't have any money.\ncaller: Do any of your banks have dormant accounts?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. The Strait is a vacation account.\nreceiver: Yeah, the post office must be a human account.\ncaller: Yeah, what about the National Bank?\nreceiver: The National Bank is the National Bank, and it's only going to have a few tens of thousands.\ncaller: How many tens of thousands do you have?\nreceiver: I'm guessing it's less than $100,000.\ncaller: What about corporate banking?\nreceiver: I've only got 80 or 900 grand.\ncaller: From eight to nine.\nreceiver: No, between 80 and 900 million won.\ncaller: Eighty thousand to ninety thousand?\nreceiver: Yes, I suppose so.\ncaller: So you have less than one million in each account.\nreceiver: I don't have it anywhere else.\ncaller: Yes, so you have less than one million yuan in your corporate and national bank accounts, and you have no assets in the rest of your accounts.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Okay, thank you for cooperating with the investigation, and now that we've attached the statements so far, and we've submitted them to the Financial Conduct Authority, and they've confirmed the victim, the case is closed, so I think you can stop worrying so much.\nreceiver: So if I'm a victim, I'm doing it on my own behalf, I've been harmed in any way, I haven't suffered a financial loss yet, but I have been harmed, and there's no monetary compensation for that, but are there any measures that are being taken?\ncaller: If you don't have the money, don't take it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

What's your relationship with a 42-year-old man named Moga?\nreceiver: I don't know anyone like that.\ncaller: This is Detective Ieyama from the Seoul Police Department's Intelligence Crime Investigation Team.\nreceiver: Who's yours and who's not?\ncaller: He's a 42-year-old male who works as a travel agent.\nreceiver: I don't know anyone named Moga.\ncaller: Because I'm going to tell you something.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Last Friday, our investigative team searched seven financial institutions that were responsible for mobile phones, and when we searched them, we seized a large number of cash boxes and cards, including a National Bank Savings Bank account that is now in the name of Mr. Ishonemi, and we called to see if it was true. Do you know anything about opening a National Bank savings bank account?\nreceiver: No, I don't know.\ncaller: Well, have you ever sold or rented anything?\nreceiver: I never have.\ncaller: Uh, we've been looking at that\nreceiver: But where do I live?\ncaller: You weren't born on Mars?\nreceiver: Yes, no, my name is changed.\ncaller: Would you like to use Mr. Ichinomiya's name now?\nreceiver: They're using that name as a pseudonym.\ncaller: Let me tell you, this was opened in March of 2015 on the Seoul side.\nreceiver: I've never forgotten my I.D., but I've always wanted to do this.\ncaller: I'm going to tell you something, so just hear me out.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, a wallet named after Mr. Ichonmi has been used by criminals for five days to launder more than 60 million yuan of illicit funds. In this case, not only Mr. Ijin, but about 130 people are involved, some of whom were paid to sell the wallet, and some of whom are suffering due to the leakage of personal data.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: But from the point of view of our police department, which is investigating this case, Mr. Ishonmi is now a suspect in this case for selling money orders. Do you understand?\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: Yeah, because the mature seed that's coming in now is a candidate.\nreceiver: This is weird.\ncaller: It's a mature seed.\nreceiver: I don't know anybody like that.\ncaller: So, listen to me: Mr. Yushun, a newcomer, was defrauded of 60 million yuan, and now he has deposited the money into an account in Mr. Ichinomiya's name, knowing that he is an accomplice and has been reported.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: First of all, in order to determine whether Mr. Ihwan is a direct participant in this incident or a victim of a leak, we will first conduct a simple initial investigation in the form of a first call recording. We will record all the conversations and leave evidence for the investigation of the case. Please answer my question simply and honestly: Are you currently on the move? Not home or work, not home or work or car?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, the reason I'm telling you this is because if you get mixed up with a third person's voice during the recording, you could be at a disadvantage later on, and I'm asking you to pay attention to this.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So let's start recording. This is a one-on-one call recording investigation of the case involving 27 33 Mogoyu. I'm an investigator for the Seoul District Police Intelligence Crime Investigation Team.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You're right. You know Mr. Mogaho?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Is it true that you opened a bank account on March 2nd, 2015 at about 2:30 p.m. at the Songpa-gu Songpa-dong branch in Seoul?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Is it true that the next day, March 3, 2015, at around 1:40 p.m., he opened an account with the People's Bank of China at a branch in Yongsan-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Have you ever sold or given your warrants to anyone?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Have you recently used an account that you didn't know had funds deposited or withdrawn?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: I don't know. Have you ever lost a year's worth of ID, a driver's license, a passport?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Are you dealing with the National Bank and the Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development?\nreceiver: It's just the Straits.\ncaller: What other banks do you deal in?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Can I just have one?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you use Internet banking, telebanking, or smart banking when you do your banking?\nreceiver: You go.\ncaller: You don't use all three at all.\nreceiver: If you use a card.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You've been cleared of any wrongdoing, and everything you've said so far is true?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Let me tell you again, this is a very large-scale incident, and dozens of victims have been confirmed to have suffered billions of dollars in financial losses.\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: There's no such thing. If the victim is right, as you say, then your personal information has been leaked to the mainstream media, and later criminals can open another account in another bank in the name of Ms. Ieyama and make illegal transactions.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The most urgent procedure right now is to conduct an account tracing investigation to prove that Ms. Ishomi is an innocent victim of criminals and conspiracy theories, and to prevent further harm from occurring, if you understand what I'm saying.\nreceiver: I don't know, because I'm out of my mind.\ncaller: I'll tell you what, from now on, we're going to investigate your accounts to see if you're the victim of a data breach, as you claim, and if you've been compromised, we'll investigate your account, and if it's under investigation right now, your account will be suspended for five days, or seven days, or three months, at the very least, for the duration of our investigation.\nreceiver: So what happens if you're suspended, what happens to the money that's being withdrawn, the monthly fees and stuff like that?\ncaller: I'm going to tell you right now, if you're suspended right now, you're going to have some inconvenience in your life, but in this case, you can apply for the Deposit Protection Act, which is a financial law that doesn't protect you for less than 5 million yuan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then you tell me about the funds that you're holding with the financier, the approximate amount, and I'll give it to you when I ask our intelligence team to look into it, and then you can talk to me about real estate liquidity.\nreceiver: What are you talking about?\ncaller: Now we're going to apply for the Deposit Protection Act, but you can't apply for anything less than 5 million.\nreceiver: It's more than five million yen.\ncaller: You can apply for more than five million won, but the current cash is the amount that Mr. Ichinomiya can withdraw.\nreceiver: Wait a minute, I'm going to park here.\nreceiver: How are you?\ncaller: Hello, who are you?

Mr. name1, do you have any nutritional supplements that you take?\ncaller: I've been taking a lot of different supplements. The first is milkshakes, because they're good for the liver. The second is vitamins, which I normally take a lot. And the third is that I've also been taking lutein from time to time, and now I don't see as well as name2, so I'm taking lutein to prevent cataracts, and I'm also taking a little bit of vitamin D to prevent corona, which is good for prevention. It's good for boosting the immune system, and what's the effect of vitamin D in cases like this?\nreceiver: I'm eating kale because it's good for the immune system, and I'm supposed to eat a total of four eggs a day, but I'm only eating about two eggs per day, because I think four eggs is too fast, and Mr. Name1 usually keeps to the dosage.\ncaller: If I have to eat more than a few times a day, it's more likely that I don't eat well because I didn't take care of it at the right time, rather than because it's missing on purpose.\nreceiver: Well, I have spondylolisthesis, and it's not a disease that has any medication, but I have to tell you that my immune system has been weak lately, and I've been having these rashes, and I was prescribed medication last week, and I got the rashes again this morning, and today I'm going to go to the pharmacy.\ncaller: Well, I'm a big fan of spinal stenosis, because I've been talking about it, but I've also had it before, and as you said, I've had it before and I've gone to the hospital for physical therapy and rehabilitation and so on, and then you said that you're having it now, and tell me specifically what's uncomfortable and where in your life you're uncomfortable now.\nreceiver: I was diagnosed with paralysis when I was in my first year of high school, and it was just that my back was hurting so much that I couldn't sit still, and my back hurt, and I used to cry a lot, and so I went to the hospital, and my bones were already stiff, and they said there was no way to move them, so I told them to do some yoga or swim, so that it wouldn't get worse, and I did a little bit of yoga, and I knew that the pain would go away quickly, and the bones would sort of fall into place, and even though I worked really hard on the yoga, it didn't work, and I felt so hopeless, so I had to exercise for a little bit longer, and I couldn' t do it fast, and I gave up, and now I feel like my back is twisting and my posture is getting worse because of my paralysis, and I'm thinking about going back to yoga and Pilates.\ncaller: Uh, I had these symptoms when I was in high school or a student of these things, and now I don't feel as uncomfortable about it as Mr. Name2 does, but do you have a family history of any of these genetic disorders that come from that house?\nreceiver: Well, first of all, I don't know any people who have psoriasis, and they say that most people are born with psoriasis. So I was thinking, my mother is healthy, my father has very straight bones, and I used to think that if I saw a finger that had a little bit of bone twisting, I'd think it had a lot of pencils in it, and it would look like a stiff arrow, and then it would be like, \"Oh, my bones are a little bit weak\".\ncaller: We don't have any serious or life-threatening illnesses in our family, except for, you know, my family, and we both have blood pressure and diabetes on our side of the family, and they say that it's hereditary, and it's a little bit important, and so I had a medical check-up a few days ago, and it wasn't complete diabetes, but it was pre-diabetic, and your blood pressure was a little bit high, and I thought, oh, this is really scary and important, and I'm trying to manage this by weight control or trying to have a little bit of a regular life, and Mr. Name2 is trying to do something about this health, whether it's exercise or lifestyle habits, is there any part of your life that you're working on?\nreceiver: I'm going to talk about lifestyle habits, because my health is a little bit genetic, and both of my parents are very good-looking, and I inherited that, so I was over 10 in both eyes, and then last year, after studying for a long time in a dark study cafe, I started to see glare, and at night, the car lights and the street lights started to come on, and I started to get cataracts, and I went to the eye doctor, and he said, \"You're free to touch your glasses now, because you're an adult, you're done growing up\", and I didn't touch my glasses for a while, but even then, it's become a habit to use your smartphone in the dark, and I still do it, and I like to feel my eyesight is getting worse there, so these days, I set up a stand next to my bed, and if I had to use my phone before that, I'd turn the stand on and replenish the light, and I'm trying to keep my health in check.\ncaller: Well, I've been trying to get a lot of free time lately, so I'm trying to do a lot of walking, and in my routine, I'm not just lying in bed, but I'm also trying to move a lot at home, so for example, I'll do it by handing out the sink, or I'll turn the dishwasher when I have time, or whatever, when I'm cleaning the room a little bit more, now I'm going to do it by moving a little bit louder, and I'm actually trying to increase my own activity, and I also try to drink a lot of water, which reminds me of something called lifestyle habits, because I'm a little bit careful about my smoking habits, so I don't smoke, and I try to eat at least once or twice a week.\nreceiver: I actually like alcohol a lot, and I like the taste of it, so I like your alcohol, and Mr. name1 said that, you know, when you drink alcohol, you lose muscle in your body very quickly, and anyway, when I drink alcohol, I feel like I'm going to be walking faster and faster throughout the day, and I don't think that's my fault, so I'm trying to reduce my drinking, and I'm realizing the seriousness of it.\ncaller: I don't have a lot of friends who smoke, and even if they do, most of my friends are men, and women don't smoke that much.\nreceiver: I have a serious disease called myasthenia gravis, and I look a little weak on the outside, but I'm surprisingly healthy, and I don't do a lot of bedwetting, and I've never been seriously injured, so I haven't been hospitalized at all.\ncaller: Well, unlike Mr. Name2, I look healthy on the outside, but on the inside, there's not much that's wrong with me, so I get sick a lot, and I have high levels of inflammation in my body, and I've had a lot of things that I don't like, and a lot of bad things, and I get hurt a lot and I get a lot of joints and this kind of thing, and I often have gypsum, and if you ask me about my hospital experience, I had a fever that went up to 40 degrees last year for some unknown reason, so I went to the hospital that day, and the doctor said, \"Oh, this is better than going to a general hospital\", and I went to that general hospital, and he said, \"Your inflammation is so high and your fever is so high, you need to be admitted right away\". So I spent three or four days in the hospital in the summer, and now I can't eat for a day and I'm constantly being beaten, but I've got a lot of experience, so I'm going to do something for my health in the future.\nreceiver: I've said that I exercise during my off-season, but I've never exercised for more than three months, so this time when I signed up for Pilates, I made an appointment with my teacher not to obsess about how fast my body is changing, but to exercise consistently for more than a year, so I'm aiming to do Pilates hard this year to build up my body and straighten my spine.\ncaller: Well, I'm like Mr. Name2, I'm going to exercise regularly now, and I'm trying to figure out a few things, and then I actually think that sleep is important for health, but I guess I can't go out much now because the government is in government, so I've been spending more time at home, and it's kind of hard for me to have a regular routine, so I slept past 3 a.m. yesterday, but I don't really feel refreshed when I go to bed late and wake up late like this, and I think that these sleep patterns affect my day a lot, so I am trying to establish a regular sleep routine in the future.\nreceiver: I had a lot of insomnia, and I fell asleep at six o'clock in the morning yesterday and today, and I think if you go out and do a lot of activity, you're going to sleep a little bit better that night, but then you have to constantly adjust your sleep pattern, and that doesn't happen, and then you're up until dawn the next day, and you say, \"Well, I had so much insomnia last year that I took a sleeping pill before I ate it, and it had side effects, and I was very nervous afterwards, and I went to bed, and I had this really weird experience, and I heard this weird sound in my head, and the light was like a flare, and my heart kept racing, and I got to go to the hospital, and I remember being so nervous that the doctor said, \"This is not a serious side effect like nutritional supplements\".\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

And this summer, I think about that girl group's lead singer a lot, but I can't hear it anymore, so I get a little nervous, and these days, when I look at the album charts, there are a lot of ballads.\ncaller: And I'm very sympathetic to what you just said about Siesta, and I think that Touch My Body is a song that's really cool when you're in summer, so in summer, in summer, you have to listen to this kind of song that is a little bit bitter and sparkly, and it's kind of empowering, it's hot and it doesn't feel like it's tiring.\nreceiver: Yeah, it's summer again, and now it's COVID-19, and you're wearing a lot of masks, and I don't really like the way you're dressed or anything, but it's hot, and I'm worried about that part, and they said it's going to rain a lot tomorrow, so I guess I'm a little freaked out, and I wonder if there's something special you do at home on a rainy day, or something you have to do on rainy days.\ncaller: I don't have to do this, because it rains so much, and then it gets wet, and then I do this, and I usually try to stay at home, and I like to take things home and send them home.\nreceiver: Yeah, that's right. I'm also a collector.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'd like to go out again in the summer, because the weather is nice, and that's why I think it's a little bit like that, and then again, if you do something in the summer it's probably those cool drinks, watermelon juice, and I think a lot of things like that. I think I've eaten a lot of watermelon, and I've had a lot of seaweed and so on, but I'm weird and oh, I like that cold drink, and I always tell you to take the oatmeal off, but I always ask you to take it off, and then I order it, and oh, so that thought comes to me and then I think about it all the time, oh, yeah, I have to ask for the oats to be taken off, and that thought comes back to me a little bit, and so on and so forth. Do you have anything you don't like in the summer?\ncaller: I don't really have anything to eat, so I eat everything, especially in the summer, when it's really cold, and I think a lot about ice cream and ice cream, but hey, if you're allergic to ice cream,\nreceiver: It's not that I'm allergic to oats, it's just that I don't like the smell of oatmeal, and it's weird, because it's okay, but there are a lot of people who don't even like oats, because they hate the smell of the oats, and they don't really like it, and there's so many people who dismiss it, and in the fall, I think about it a lot, and I think it's kind of weird, but before the fall, there's something that reminds me a lot of the DaVinci singer, DaVinci, and at first the music came out when I was a freshman in college, and then when I was in high school, and then the song came out, and it was such a good time for us to be singing together, so I remember a lot of that, and I wonder if there's a movie or a song in the fall that you think about so early.\ncaller: I don't remember the movie or the song, but the trench coat reminds me of something else. Now, when someone comes out wearing a trenchcoat, it's the beginning of autumn. It's kind of symbolic that you do this, and the song doesn't come out as clearly as the spring you remember.\nreceiver: I think there's a lot of similar styles that come out in the fall, and I think you mentioned trench coats, and I really sympathized with that, because the trench coat has a lot of lines and shoulder lines and lengths and stars and buttons and things like that, and they're all very different, but when you look at it from a distance, they all look the same, and it's really flawed, and in autumn, I think I'm going to think about jeans again. Of course, I can wear all four seasons, but it's just something that looks better in the fall specifically, and then again in autumn like this, because I think there are a lot of traffic jams, and then you're going to be wearing a lot of southern clothes, and then southern, and then autumn, and then a lot more southern clothes.\ncaller: I have to go, but I'm not ready to go shopping yet, and I'm trying to buy some summer clothes, but I don't know what to buy these days.\nreceiver: Yeah, that's what it looks like, and lately I've been going to some underground stores or something, and I'm shopping on the Internet, and it looks like this dress, and there's a lot of price difference, and then I'm thinking, oh, maybe someone else is wearing this, and I think, if I'm going to buy something really unusual, maybe it's not just me, but it's something that I think about a lot, and it's always a little bit of a hassle when I buy clothes.\ncaller: It's not that I don't want to, but it's a little bit shorter, and I used to like it a little bit, but now I'm uncomfortable with it because it's short, and it's pants, and I'm hot, and it is hot, and I have to figure out what to do.\nreceiver: It's just that when I wear shorts on the subway or the bus, I sweat a little bit, and that's all that's left, and then it's like, oh, it's hot and you're wearing long pants, and there's a lot of those things, and when I talk about winter, I think the first thing that comes to mind is pancakes, and then there's the sea bass that we eat on the street, and then pancakes.\ncaller: The food, the food, I remembered the real bread, the hot stew, the real summer, the real winter, I think it reminds me a little bit more of the snow, the snow-eyed, the skiing, the ski-skiing, the cups that you eat when you go skiing, it tastes poisonous.\nreceiver: Oh, yes, it's true that the food at the ski resort is really delicious, and the food is actually delicious at any time, but in the summer, after swimming and eating, I think it's really delicious and in the autumn I just eat it in the amusement park or something like that in the Han River, and it's very delicious, but I don't particularly find it in the spring, but it's a little bit like that, and probably now in the summer we'll do a lot of this kind of festival in Samarkand because of the corona, but maybe we won't be able to do it, so I think something has lost that advantage of the summer, and I'm a little bit sad. Have you ever participated in a festival or something that you remember about the summer?\ncaller: I've been wanting to participate, I've always wanted to participate, but there's this thing called walking on the beach, and I wanted to participate in something like that, whether it's this year or not, and now it's like that, and I've gone to a rock festival in Samarkand once before, and it's been really colorful, and I just sprinkle water and I just do that, and now, in the summer, in the spring, I think about it a little bit more, if you're standing in a water park like this or something like that on the road, a packed car, a village like this, it's a little bit poisonous, and the weather is just right, and I think about that a lot when I'm campaigning in the evening.\nreceiver: I used to have something like that in the summer, but I think it's a little bit less now, so it's kind of sad, and then in the summer you have to eat a lot again, you can eat a lot of ice cream when you're cold, but you find ice cream like that again, but in the old days, when dads would buy you a Biviq or something, or a melon, or something like that, or a megatonba, I used to buy a lot of these things, and I used to really hate them, because I like the color of the potatoes, and I like the tangerines, and I love the scallops, but my dad is always in the fridge, or I just hate these things, but now I have to eat them again, and they taste good, and I feel like the taste changes a lot more, and in the summertime, I feel like I'm in a little bit of a summer vacation.\ncaller: I don't think I've ever had arthritis in the summer, but it's a bit of a problem with toxic food in the summer so I think you have to be very careful with food like kimbab and you have to eat it on a certain date, especially in the summer when you eat food, and you mentioned ice cream, but this time it's called Bibibick, the black-haired Bibibick.\nreceiver: Okay, I'll give you a taste of that.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

First of all, we don't just want the Republic of Korea, we want the whole world to see North Korea negotiate denuclearization, because North Korea is doing so much in this world, and it's doing so many other things, so I don't know how denuclearisation is going to happen, but in this situation, even if Kim Jong-un doesn't negotiate or denuclearize, how do you think he's going to go about it in the future, in line with what's going on in the world right now, around the globe?\ncaller: I think Kim Jong-un is going to continue to attack, and I think he's going to go in the direction of self-interest, pretending to cooperate with countries all over the world, but if it doesn't help his country, I think he will break his promise at any time, because he's been doing it since Kim Il-sung, and if we don't want the North Korean system to collapse, I think we'll continue to attack that part practically.\nreceiver: I think North Korea is sticking to denuclearization right now, because if they don't have a nuclear weapon, there's nothing else they can do, so they're sticking to it, and there's a lot more that they can do with that nuclear weapon, and it's obvious that the United States, or any other country in the world, or anywhere else in the world -- not the U.S. -- they're pushing North Korea to do that, because they're getting a lot of it with weapons, and they're trying to stick to it until the end, and from our point of view, even though we'd like to see that happen, North Korea is holding that nuclear weapon like a hostage, and so we're going to try to negotiate some other kind of pre-conditions and deal with it, and anybody in any country that wants to do that is going to try and push for denuclearisation, but if the Kim Jong-un regime doesn't collapse, it's going to be very hard to do that this time.\ncaller: I think it's virtually impossible on that part, because our country is totally supportive of North Korea, and Trump is putting pressure on North Korea right now, and we're having disagreements with each other, and we don't have a timetable, and it's constantly being delayed, so it's almost impossible on that side, and Kim Jong-un, because Kim Jong-il is not cooperative right now, I don't think any way that he presents will be acceptable to the North Korean side right now. So it's really impossible that there's going to be a denuclearization conference in the Trump administration, and in the Moon Jae-in presidency, so look, one day North Korea will be denuclearized.\nreceiver: No, I don't think that's going to happen for a while, but anyway, if North Korea doesn't have a nuclear weapon, then they don't have any weapons in the world to threaten or intimidate or negotiate with the United States or our country, and that's because North Korea has no economic level other than a nuclear one, because their society is so poor right now, and they're so economically backward in the world, and so now the Kim Jong-un regime, and so Kim Jong-Un's regime is focusing much more on the nuclear right now and a lot more of their time and a lot of their effort is focused on the nuclear like this.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

The people who called him were more than 200 people nationwide.\nreceiver: Shouldn't you ask your family?\ncaller: If you've been identified as a victim, you can tell your family, but you can't tell anyone else about it until you're identified as the victim.\nreceiver: Will you call me when you're done?\ncaller: As soon as I've finished investigating the first victim, you'll be contacted directly by the prosecutor, and you will either be acquitted, or you'll open an illegal warrant through some perpetrator, and if there are no charges against you, you will be exonerated, or if there are any, you will come to us and we'll proceed with an investigation.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Do you understand me?\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: Where are you on the phone right now, your home or your office?\nreceiver: The office.\ncaller: There's a colleague in the office.\nreceiver: Yeah, I was just coming out of the hallway.\ncaller: Oh, you're in the hallway.\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: As I said before, if you speak in the third person during your call, you may be fined. Also, if you withhold information during the recorded investigation, you will be charged under Criminal Code Section 153 (1) and (2), criminal offence 152, and Criminal Code 132 (1). Please note this point. If you wait a moment, we will proceed with the recording.\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: Are you sure?\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: Is the phone number 010 9275 2291 correct?\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: Your identity has been verified.

There was a situation where criminals used 25 million, 8.5 million, 33.5 million in transactions that you didn't even recognize during the illegal transaction.\nreceiver: You don't know that.\ncaller: Then you'll have to give a statement, and because it's a recorded phone call, you never have to tell us your personal information, account number, or password.\nreceiver: I don't know the details, but I'm sure he's talking about some kind of commander.\ncaller: Where do you use your credit cards?\nreceiver: Credit card checks just in the house.\ncaller: Give me a call.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: When you get a call from the police, tell them that this is the case number of the police investigation.\ncaller: Yes, hello, hello, I've changed my phone. I can send it first. You always have the case number that was forwarded to you. How does your case number work?\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: First, I'm going to try to verify the identity of the caller.\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: I'm sending you a message, and I'm on the phone right now.\nreceiver: Yes.\ncaller: Give me your number, I'll call you back.\ncaller: Yes, call 02 1301 and tell him to put me through to Inspector Kim Joon Choon.\nreceiver: Is that 013?\ncaller: This is 1301.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: One hundred and thirty one.\nreceiver: One hundred and thirty one.\ncaller: This is the number of our representative, and we'll send you a notice and a summons to your residence.\nreceiver: No, I'm calling right now. I'll walk you through it.\ncaller: No, you can call him yourself. It doesn't matter.\ncaller: I'll send you the papers and the subpoena, so don't worry, just call me when you're ready, okay?\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

What are the characteristics of yomi?\nreceiver: And Yomi, like I said before, he's very affectionate and he follows people very well, and Yomi, unlike other dogs, he learns to eat on his own, so he eats when he wants to eat, and he doesn't eat when he's not feeling well, and it seems that Yomi really likes snacks, and unlike the other dogs, Yomi doesn't seem to have a lot of barking or anything like that, but when he hears the doorbell or someone coming in the hallway, he barks really loud, and the other times he barks not really, and then Yomi likes snacks because he has snacks and I think I can eat them, and then he listens to me, and he really hates being educated, and he hasn't been able to teach his hands yet, and he can only sit down and do this, so if there's a chance, Yomi is four years old, and he's too old to hear words, and I really want to teach my hands.\ncaller: When I first brought him in, I wanted him to be a genius puppy, so that he could put his poo in the urine pad, but the more space he had to clear the fence, the more urination mistakes he made, so he said to my dad, \"You know, I'm tired of flying around, and I'm sick of looking at you, and now I think I can cover my pee with a hundred pounds, and sitting is really a characteristic of dogs, and they listen to me when I'm eating, so I know I can do a hundred pounds sitting, and now the thing I want to do is educate them, and I want to teach them to break their trash a little bit, and that's hard for them, but I'm going to have to be patient, and I just want to get through this period, and I also want to teach him, because I'm old enough to eat snacks, and I have to tell him or give him advice.\nreceiver: He's only a three-month-old puppy, and Yomi Yomi's behaviour makes me want him to do the same thing. At first I thought he was really good at scratching people, but now I think he's not going to be good at it, and I think I'll have to learn to listen to him when he's eating snacks. And then I said he's really good at it because he's still only three months old, but if he eats a lot of snacks, he'll get fat like Yomi. Yomi has a lot of friends, and people say he's cute, and he eats lots of snacks. That's why Yomi has gained more weight than other dogs, and that's why I don't want her to get sick when she eats period pills, and if she eats snacks often, she'll get skin diseases like that.\ncaller: Before I had a puppy, before I had a dog, I had Max, who I mentioned earlier, and I had guinea pigs, and hamsters, and reptiles, and I also had fish, and I only liked those animals when I brought them, and I didn't have that kind of affection for them, especially hamsters, which I had a lot of, and my parents let me have them because I love animals so much instead of dogs, and the hamster came from Home Flowers with two crab lions, and it even mated with our house, and it gave birth to a chick, so I had lots of animals, but have you ever had any other animals?\nreceiver: Before I moved here, I had a lot of watermelon dogs and cocker spaniels at home, but they all stank, and I would give them to people I knew, and I had a dog that I had for a really long time, and it was a watermelon dog, and it got bitten by a puppy on a walk with my mom, and the dog that I've been asking about once, I want to be able to train it well, and I have a relative that I know who does that in animal training, and I've assigned it to him, and I want to tell you one episode about the watermelon, when I was about five years old, I was feeding watermelon food, and I was walking around with a bowl of food in my hand, and all of a sudden it bit my hand and scared me, and I got a lot of blood and sweat out of my hands, and then I was like, \"Oh, my God, I'm so surprised you've ever been bitten by an animal\".\ncaller: I've been bitten by a puppy, and I had a really big dog in my apartment on the fifth floor, and it was a very big dog, and he was really nice, and he didn't bark at people, and he kind of thought that I was young or that I was low-ranking, so I tried to hug that big dog and I got bitten once.\nreceiver: Mr. name2, is there an animal you'd like to adopt that isn't a dog?\ncaller: I've had a lot of other animals besides dogs, and I don't like cats very much either, so I wouldn't want to have any other animals than dogs at all.\nreceiver: Oh, I've always wanted to raise a turtle, because they're cute and they have a nice dorsal fin, and I really want to raise a parrot, because one of my favorite singers has a white parrot, and it grows so well, and it moves so well, whether it has bones or not, so I'd really like to raise the parrot.\ncaller: I'm going to take a walk with another friend who has a dog, in a place called Forbidden Park that I used to go to, and in another block of flats.\nreceiver: Oh, I go to the park a lot, and there's a lot of other purebred dogs like me in the park, so the Maltese seems to me to have a really good temperament, and they're really friendly with the Yomies that I have, and one of them is a black dog, a black dog that I don't know, and Yomies seem to really like the dog, and she's a little bit bigger than the Maltese, and the other Maltese is a little bit faster, but Yomies are a little bit slower, so I'd like to see Yomies be a little bit quicker than the other dogs, and the Pomeranian, Yomies, and the Formelani, they're a little bit more friendly, so I would like to go out there a lot and meet a lot of the dogs and the yomies.\ncaller: The only dogs he's ever seen are the huge Pomeranians that he has at the pet store, and the Maltese that his friend has, and I think he's not very sociable, because he's scared all the time, and he's a bigger dog than he is, so he's very shaky, so he keeps shakin' his body, and then he keeps showing the dogs, and he plans to go to a puppy cafe to help him socialize faster.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It's usually available right after it's issued.\nreceiver: If you want to receive a proxy, you have to register it yourself.\ncaller: A: If you receive it directly, you can use it without registering it, and then we'll take it to the company.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. Seoul City, Seoul District, Seoul East. And what is the credit card limit? Can I set the limit?\ncaller: If it's adjustable, I'd like it to be $30,000, because I think it's harder to manage if it's too high.\ncaller: And I'd like to make the deadline the first of the month, if that's possible.\ncaller: Thank you.\ncaller: No further questions.

(Laughter) Yeah, this is the same person that I'm the victim of right now, who was swindled out of 60 million, and put the money into an account in the teacher's name.\nreceiver: Why did you put money in that account?\ncaller: I've been tricked by your gang of crooks.\nreceiver: Mom, what's going on?\ncaller: And a fraudulent group embezzled the money, and now you think you're a fraud, too.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: Yes, and since the complaint was filed with the welfare office, your teacher is on our side, identifying the victim and taking steps to prevent further harm.\nreceiver: How am I supposed to do that?\ncaller: So we're in the process of doing this kind of damage control, and I'm just going to ask you a few questions as a matter of procedure.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Yes, and as you know, we'll be recording all your calls and leaving them as evidence for the investigation.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Well, then I'd like you to answer my question simply and clearly and honestly.\nreceiver: What do you say?\ncaller: Yes, then answer my question honestly.\nreceiver: Which police station did you say?\ncaller: Yes, I'll tell you.

Should we get them over the phone? Shouldn't we get them by fax or something?\ncaller: All of a sudden, what part of our client is causing this?\nreceiver: No, it's just that the fax is more convenient, and I really like my phone.

This is just weird, like the phone call from Katoch said, and if you check with Katoch, the page won't go right, so it's going to take a while.\ncaller: Oh, that's all right.\nreceiver: How are you?\ncaller: I thought you were talking, so I didn't say anything.\nreceiver: Yeah.

(I want to ask) / (I would like to ask) A + Even though I read the manual, I have no investment experience or financial knowledge, I can not understand what you are talking about, so I would like your staff to help me.\ncaller: I don't have a full-time job right now, but I started an internship last month for six months, and I think I'll be paid by the first half of next year. It's not much, but after taxes and insurance, I think the net money coming into my account is about 1450000 yuan per month.\ncaller: But it's not an internship, you can't get a job at your current company, so you have to keep preparing for the job while you're there, and you've spent almost all of the money you've saved so far, and if you stop interning, you'll have to put aside the living expenses and tuition costs necessary to start studying for a full-time job.\ncaller: So I'd like to find a way to save some money and get interest, which is usually a deposit or a deposit, but it's usually a short one-year term.\ncaller: But the risky investments, like stocks and funds, are better than savings, but I don't know how to invest yet, and I'm scared that I'm going to lose all the money I've invested, and I think it's better to just sit back and enjoy the interest rate.\nreceiver: How's the CMA?\ncaller: I've been looking for products and reading the product description and the terms and conditions, and I've found that RP products have a good rate of return, but it's a securities brokerage model, so it doesn't protect depositors, and there's a risk of loss of cash.\ncaller: Of course, they're investing in bonds that are safe and low-risk, but if they don't have the money, it's life-threatening.\nreceiver: Do you have any other conditions?\ncaller: I think the most important thing is the cash collateral, the stability, and I think it's okay to have a deposit or a deposit, but it's not a huge amount to put in, and it's also not a lot of money to hold for a long time, and then the higher the interest rate, the better, and I want the contract to be as short as possible so that I can terminate immediately after the internship.\nreceiver: The shortest period of time is six months.\ncaller: I think it's good if it's at the end of the internship, and I'm just starting out in social life, and my patterns of consumption are so overwhelming that it's hard to save regularly, but what if I don't put in a certain amount of money every month on a regular basis, which is a disadvantage, and I have a reserve that I can adjust monthly depending on my situation?\nreceiver: There's also free will.\ncaller: So let's say I set my monthly savings at $300,000/$300,000, and I sign up for a free account, and if I put less than that or I don't put any money in, there's no disadvantage?\ncaller: But here I see that when you do it with a one-year/one-year periodic payment, the interest rate is 2.5 times higher than five times this point. If you collect more, you collect more interest, and even if you have to save 300 thousand yuan / thirty thousand yen each, it's a little bit confusing because the money you can collect is also certain. If you sign a one year/one year contract, is it difficult to balance?\nreceiver: It is possible.\ncaller: Does \"possible\" mean you can't get the interest, but you can get the principal back?\ncaller: But if you quit your internship and don't get a job right away, it's the first semester of the recruitment process, and you don't have time to write a resume, prepare for exams, prepare for interviews, and you haven't got any money saved, and if you want to save even $30,000 a month, then you're going to have to go out and get another job, and you're not going to have enough time to do that.\ncaller: And every month, I have to make travel plans with my high school classmates.\ncaller: And there are days when the company that is doing the internship is a bit far away from home and has to pay daily transportation expenses, so they have to take a taxi every day (3000 won) / ((three thousand won)) for a monthly (90000 won)) / ((five thousand won)) expense, and then they lose more than 100,000 won from their salary.\ncaller: Luckily, the company pays for lunch, but after living expenses, medical expenses, and all that stuff, there's barely enough money left, because there might be a month when we don't have enough money.\nreceiver: How about 6 months/ 6 months?\ncaller: Yeah, I'll just do that. Do you need to open a new wallet? I've already created a wallet that I don't use, and I think it's a good idea to switch accounts with it.\nreceiver: It's difficult.\ncaller: I'm just wondering if it's okay for me to open a new savings account and then close the safe deposit box that's in my name, because up until a few years ago, there was a trend where it was difficult to open an account, and I didn't get rid of it because I thought it would be useful someday.\ncaller: It's hard to keep track of all the ones you have, because you don't want to leave out the ones you don' t use, and they don' t come in.\nreceiver: Please call us with your full name and social security number.\ncaller: We're going to do this.\nreceiver: You have 31 yuan in your account, can I transfer it?\ncaller: Yes, when you open a savings account later, you can transfer it there, and if there's a transfer fee, just take it to the bank.\ncaller: A/ And if it's $300,000/$300,000 every month for six months/$600,000/$100,000, if you fill in the middle and spend more than that, is it possible to withdraw the rest of the money if it doesn't go below $800,000/$200,000?\nreceiver: (2 times) / (this round) is good.\ncaller: A/ Yes, how do I sign up? Can I do it over the phone or do I have to do it in person after the call?\nreceiver: Go to our website right now and apply for a new savings account.\ncaller: Wait a minute, I'm just going to press me+this+apply, and I'm going to have to do one of two things: validate the certificate and authenticate the IPIN?\ncaller: I've verified it, and I've entered my name and social security number, and the rest of my cell phone, plus my cell phone number, plus my e-mail, plus my address, plus everything else, and I finally checked my marketing inbox, and I wondered if I could only get e-mails, or if I could just get text messages, which is kind of annoying.\nreceiver: It's both.\ncaller: Now, if I agree to this, and it turns out that we're running an event with Trump Financial Securities for regular, free-float subscribers with monthly interest rates of less than $300,000/$300,000, and converting them into monthly interest-bearing products, does that include me?\ncaller: But the condition is that you have to issue a W/DW card and fill in the balance sheet, and then it's going to be harder for you to spend more money and save money. I'm just going to check your consent to receive information in an email and not participate in that event.\ncaller: If it says the application is complete, does that mean I'm done?\nreceiver: Yes, you can set up an account.\ncaller: Ah, now I don't see the deposit account. It's in the deposit you just made. Ah, I forgot something important. When is the monthly withdrawal?\nreceiver: It's the 14th day.\ncaller: So this month is over, what do we do? It's too late to start next month, and now (31 yuan) / (thirty one yuan) has been deposited, so the deposit has been opened? So this month (300000 yuan) / ((thirty million yuan) can just be put in.\ncaller: Thank you. I have to move in today.

Well, well, I think it's because we've never been to Japan and invaded Japan before, and I think that's because back then, well, Japan is an island, and there's a lack of resources, and I don't think that it's a very ignorant country to kill and destroy and plunder, and it's not like we've been invaded twice, but it's normal for us to come and plunder.\nreceiver: So I think we need to increase our technological capabilities, because as the country gets richer, there's going to be a little bit less of this, and we're going to have to do a little bit more of this sort of thing, and we need to do it fast, and we have to do it quickly. Of course, we shouldn't fight, but if we don't want to fight, we have to build up our strength, which is the most important thing to do. You know, Japan has an imperialist mindset, and they think they're the right country to conquer the world of fish, and that makes me very angry.\ncaller: I don't know if it's a characteristic of Japanese people, but they've always thought of it as their slave country. Now it's like in the movies, they're abused and tortured by the Japanese, and in the past they said that they bite their noses and ears, and that's why they bite their mouths, but I think it's true that even in the literature of the Neolithic era, it came out in poetry, and there was a line that said that they had no noses and no ears, but looking at it, I think I wrote a poem about the pain of the Japanese people because they dominated Japan, which accelerated the development of our country. So some people might talk about something like that, then they put on a train or something, they built a railway line, which was to load all the goods on top of the factory and take them to Korea, then they brought it to Japan for transportation and then they put it on a ship to take it to Korea, and then they told the fishermen for their own benefit, or something like that.

After the first renewal, I pay it back the next month, and after that there is no annual record, because the credit rating went down and then it went up again.\nreceiver: Let me see.\ncaller: Check it out right away.\nreceiver: You can go up to $4,000,000.\ncaller: Oh, can't we have 50 million?\ncaller: We can't do anything about it, so we're going to limit it to $4 million.\ncaller: If we adjust the threshold, will it be 4 million yuan this month?\ncaller: So if I've used up $300,000, I have an extra $1 million available this month?\ncaller: Thank you. I had to use it in a hurry because it was all gone.\nreceiver: Do you have any more questions?\ncaller: I'd like to check your card details, but I haven't received any mail for my card details.

Send it to me.\nreceiver: Please confirm your mobile number.\ncaller: Your mobile number is 010 2424 2424.\ncaller: And if I use a credit card, is there any way to pre-close before the withdrawal date?\ncaller: Do credit card prepayments reduce your interest and fees?\ncaller: Oh, so it doesn't matter if you prejudge several times in the middle?\ncaller: Uh, thank you for your confirmation, and is there any way that I can check the zero-day usage on my credit card this month?\ncaller: Yes, then please check the zero-day card usage history.\nreceiver: He used it in five-day-old shops and convenience stores.\ncaller: Is it possible to delete the scope of use so that it doesn't appear in the specification?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Yeah, well, then I'm gonna have to ask you to delete the zero-day record.\ncaller: Yeah, is there any way to delete the manifest records yourself?\nreceiver: It is possible.\ncaller: Tell me how to do it.\nreceiver: When you use the app, you can select a manual thermometer in the card usage section.\ncaller: Oh, thank you. Is that available anytime?\nreceiver: It's only possible before the billing process.\ncaller: Uh, thank you. Can you check the billing schedule, please?\nreceiver: That's 11 days before the deadline.\ncaller: Thank you for confirming.

Is 20 days possible?\ncaller: Yes, thank you. So the card limit has been changed to 20 days for a $4 million letter of credit, correct?\ncaller: Thank you. Do you mind if I install the card app to verify my credentials with the app?\ncaller: Thank you for your help. You can get a memo in text, and you can check it with Apple, right?\ncaller: Okay, that's all I need to know. Have a nice day.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.

I've heard that there's a lot of people in the arts who are exempted from this kind of exemption, but I don't know if they've actually been exempted from it, but I think that sports have a higher percentage of exemptions than other fields, because sports are mostly knighted, and if you get a lot of gold medals, then it's officially exempt.\nreceiver: Well, no matter how legally regulated and managed and made transparent in every part of it, no matter what part of the law it is, there's bound to be someone who finds that flawed part, digs into it, exploits it, improves upon it, and it always looks that way.

So once we verified on January 7 that the directory was opened in your name, and by mid-March of this year, we verified that the transaction has now taken place, because Mr. Kim Soo Hyun is the directory in your name and now the third victim is somewhat of a problem because if you say you were a victim, you didn't know a person named Kim Dong Chul before, and now you have never visited the location, and if you are a victim, then you must now provide sufficient evidence that you are the victim, and when you failed to do so, you are now naturally classified as a victim, so you are now also responsible for compensation for any claims made in your name.\nreceiver: But what about me? What about the Strait and the bank?\ncaller: It's a new bank.\nreceiver: If you go to Shinhan Bank and check the information on the opening of the exchange, can you confirm it?\ncaller: Yes, it's possible, and I'll tell you about it later, because the warrant was actually found at the scene of the crime, and we had it frozen.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you have any idea what this freeze means?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: First of all, what does \"freeze\" mean when you think about it from the point of view of our investigation, in a case like Mr. Kim Soo Hyun's, you are now the investigator and now the referent.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, what this means is that it's not yet clear whether you're a victim or a perpetrator, and we're not completely ruling out the possibility of perpetrators, and that's why I'm talking about this series of investigations, because if you're going to try to shut down an account now, or if you are going to attempt to suppress or conceal the evidence of how you're actually moving the funds into a safe account, it means that we're preventing individuals from being able to look into that account or do any of those things.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, I've just told you that you can go to the bank and verify it, but you can't verify it on your own because it's part of the freeze-out process, and you're already under investigation by the prosecutor's office, so you have to call the police in your district, and you have to pay a visit to the store.\nreceiver: Who are you, anyway?\ncaller: This is a transferred investigator from the Seoul Central Police Department's Advanced Crime Investigation Team.\nreceiver: So I'm going to go to the police station in the jurisdiction where I live, and I'm just going to ask a simple question and take him to the bank and check.\ncaller: OK, and then you can contact us later. Can you check in today?\nreceiver: I'll try that.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: That's all I have to do right now.\ncaller: Now, since you're hoping that we'll deny it, we've told you how to do it, because we've called you to ask you a wired recording question, and because we have to determine first of all how connected you are, you've told us that way to verify your account, and because you're now ignoring the wired currency itself.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: That's why we're going to send you a request to appear at your home address in the registry, and if it's accepted, you'll have to come to our precinct and be interviewed in person.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, I'll help you with that.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I know.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

This is a group, this is going to a place, if you want something to eat, I want to eat this, but when I went to Malaysia, this is a local food, why do you have to go there and eat fast food, you have to eat hamburgers.\ncaller: I've been to Canada and the U.S. a few times when I was a kid, and then I've traveled to Taiwan with my family when I was in high school, and more recently I've travelled to Japan with my sister and my brother, and I went to Vietnam with my boyfriend before the outbreak of the coronavirus, and then we booked a package in February with the idea of going on a family vacation, but now the coronavirus is overwhelming us, and we've had restrictions on entry since the day we left, and I booked the package at the train station, and I got that information, and they canceled the package, and I knew that if we didn't book the package, we were going to go to the airport and tell them, and I thought, well, thank goodness for the package.\nreceiver: And so, in my case, there's a trauma in the package, and I can't help but think about that trip, and if you're traveling, and you're eating that food, and it's the most delicious thing you've ever tasted while traveling, whether it's a foreign trip or a domestic trip or a foreign trip.\ncaller: I went to Vietnam once, and I had to save some money because I was there with my boyfriend for 10 days, so I went there for a little bit, and I've never been to Southeast Asia, so I like the Southeast Asian cuisine, and it's much cheaper than ours, so I don't have to worry about spending a lot of money, and I can eat local food without saying much.\nreceiver: I want to go to a lot of places, but really, if I have to go to only one country before I live and die, I'd like to go to Croatia, which is like my second homeland, and because I'm a dual citizen in my mind, if I only had to go to one place once, it would be Croatia before I die, which is a long story, but Croatia is a small country, and this is the sea, island by island, mountain by mountain, flip by flip, there's a fairy tale about living, and there's also the Plitvice Lakes, and it's really dark, and I think it's a country with an onion-like charm, so if you can't go to just one country before you die, where do you want to go?\ncaller: My favorite country to go to is South America, so I don't want to go to just one country, but I'd like to go to all of South America, but it's better to go when you're young than it's going to be hard because you're old, so I'm saving money now.\nreceiver: If you're traveling domestically, where do you want to go when the coronavirus is over?\ncaller: I want to go to Jeju Island, because, as I said before, I couldn't go to Saipan because of the coronavirus, and I was waiting for a reservation and a trip to Jeju at the time, and I canceled because I was afraid that there were too many Chinese people in Jeju Island at the beginning of the coronavirus.\nreceiver: I'd like to go up to Seoul and see what it's like to go to Seoul once, and people in Daegu think about things in different ways, and there's a lot of traffic, and you have to figure it out and make a lot of plans, but in Seoul, Seoul is big, and there are so many things to see, but there's so much you haven't seen yet, so I think Seoul is Seoul.\ncaller: Where do you like to go when you're traveling domestically?\nreceiver: I'd like to go to the zoo all day long because I love the plants, and I love taking them with me, and if you're going on a trip, the corona is going to become a species, and I said, \"Oh, we're going to the zoo\", and I wanted to go there.\ncaller: I'm going to eat some seafood because I had seafood once in Jersey, and it's so good that I think I want to eat it again, and I haven't eaten it in years, so something about seafood is that it's more delicious to go to Jersey than to eat it here, so yeah, I definitely want to go and eat seafood in Jersey again.\nreceiver: I love sweatpants, I love sweats, and when I went to the Giveaway Package, I tried sweatpantles and butter pudding and stuff, and my mom made a tasting menu, and I ate it, and it tasted good, and then I put some vegetables in the butter, and I gave it to her, and it became a steal. It's a problem because sweats are so expensive, and I just want to eat sweats once, and I want to eat them once, and if you're traveling, if the coronavirus is over, where would you like to go on a trip abroad?\ncaller: I'd like to go to Thailand, but when I first went to Vietnam, the perception of Southeast Asia was so good, I wanted to go with them to Thailand, the neighboring country. When I was originally planning to go to Vietnam, I was going to go with Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, all this way, but it was a little bit more expensive, anyway, because it was difficult, and I went to Vietnam.\nreceiver: Yes, I'm from Taiwan, and why I want to go to Taiwan is because my company, Daniel, last year, when I was at the company, my boss at the company used the weekend to come in on a Friday and come in on Friday and go to Taiwan and stay there on Saturday and then come back to Bangkok on Monday morning and do what's called an owl tour, which is easy to say, it's really hard, but it's not an exaggeration to say that I went to eat at three o'clock in the afternoon to continue eating, but I really want to go out to Taiwan and try to eat something delicious with zero calories.\ncaller: Taiwan is so good with Korean food and Korean people, and it tastes so good. It's delicious.\nreceiver: And then you want to go to Malaysia on your own, and there's local food, and this is something about local food, so it's attractive in cases like Malaysia, you have some Indian food, Chinese food, local Malaysian food, you have a fusion of things, you have this particular Indian food, they say it's especially delicious over there.\ncaller: I'm definitely an individual traveler, and I do a lot of marketing for hotels and better places once the package is in place, but I really don't want to spend a lot of money on accommodation, because it's just sleeping, washing, bathing, and I'm really, really dirty, and it doesn't matter if it's like this or not, so I'd rather save money for accommodation and spend it on, you know, sightseeing or museums or monuments or restaurants or whatever, and I would rather go on a free trip, and that's what I really like to do, because I like to move around a lot.\nreceiver: I've told you before, and I've said it before, that because of the trauma, they don't care about the accommodation, but if it's a woman alone, the security is something that can't be ignored, so I think it's better to think about safety and spend a little more money on accommodation.\ncaller: I didn't think much about safety myself, but when I went to Vietnam, I almost got my ass handed to me, so I was like, oh, I'm wearing this hip-color, and I'm reaching out to get my bag, and then I'm trying to hit it with my motorcycle, and I don't really think about safety, but the more countries like that are less secure than Korea, I think you have to worry about that.\nreceiver: I think it's probably a good idea to take care of your accommodation when you're on your own, because there's a risk of sexual assault and so on, and I think it might be a good idea, but I'd like to see this when I'm traveling, for example, a museum, or a beach, or an experiential program.\ncaller: I would love to go to Machu Picchu in Peru, because it's a place that I really want to go to as a grown-up, and it's my dream to be able to go there and see the sunshine and the scenery.\nreceiver: Well, I'd like to do some hiking and snorkeling.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Basically, they both have the same 2.4% interest rate, but if you meet two conditions, you get an additional 0.5% interest rate and you can sign up for a 2.9% interest rate, right?\ncaller: The eligibility requirements are to use a bank cheque card with a monthly limit of 100,000 yuan or more and subscribe to a smartphone app.\nreceiver: Yes, but there's one more challenge.\ncaller: Oh, there's one more challenging condition at the bottom, and I'm glad I was looking to see if I missed something because it didn't match the maximum interest rate I know.\ncaller: So, if you choose to deposit automatically with the additional challenging advantages, you're going to get an additional 0.6% interest rate, so the maximum challenging interest rate is going to be 3.4%?\ncaller: So even though savings accounts and challenge accounts have the same basic interest rate of 2.4 percent, the interest rate varies depending on whether or not the preferential conditions are met, and there's one more preferential condition that the challenge accounts can meet, so the maximum interest rate can be higher than the savings accounts.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: From what I saw on the website, I wasn't sure if I was getting it right, but the counselor confirmed it, and it feels easy.\ncaller: I just wish there was a website that explained the deposit products and other things in a way that people could understand, so that they wouldn't have to bother calling and checking, because they couldn't really understand it if they asked other people.\nreceiver: You did.\ncaller: Do you think I should talk to my advisor about these things, or should I leave them somewhere on the website, because I don't think many people, including myself, have access to this information effectively.\nreceiver: Please leave your comments on the bank's website.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.

I've never done that.\ncaller: We can't just rely on what the parties say and not investigate, because it's a small transaction, but there are more victims than we thought.\nreceiver: No, because I didn't, and all of a sudden, on the phone, this is happening.\ncaller: We're still trying to establish the exact correlation, but your account is suspected to be involved, and we need you to cooperate with the investigation, and if you do, this case can be resolved quickly.\nreceiver: I don't know what to do, how to cooperate.\ncaller: First, I'm going to send you a request for investigation assistance, and after you've verified this document, please follow our instructions, and we'll need to go through the process of verifying your account details, and reviewing remedies.\nreceiver: Oh, that's right outside.\ncaller: We're going to have to go through this again, but if you hear anything else, or anything like that, it's not evidence, so please move to a quiet area.\nreceiver: Yes, we're on our way.\ncaller: Yes. It shouldn't take too long to gather evidence. Please act quickly.\nreceiver: Yes, we're on the move.\ncaller: Now, this is a very complicated case, and if you do what we're asking you to do, it's going to be very helpful in solving this case, because first of all, we need the bill of lading to replicate the damage repair, which is going to be an important piece of evidence in the investigation, okay?\nreceiver: You want me to pay the bill?\ncaller: Yes, yes, it's a necessary part of the investigation, so after you pay for a purchase order on a social commerce site, you can tell us your purchase order identification number, or PIN, so we can process the case quickly.\nreceiver: Uh, but I'm so confused right now, and I was wondering if maybe I could come over tomorrow and sort it out by phone, because I'm... I'm confused and I don't understand.\ncaller: Mr. Kim Sung Joon, I just called you to make a quick phone call, to take care of you, do you understand?\nreceiver: But I'm so confused right now, I have to pay the bill, and this is...\ncaller: I explained to him that it was part of the investigation, that he was coming in person, that there would be more victims during that time, and that it would not be as simple as a wire investigation, but rather, if it looks like you're trying to avoid this situation, it's going to be even more difficult to say that you're not involved in this case, and why do you complicate the situation, because you have to cooperate with the investigation now and show that you have nothing to do with this case, understand?\nreceiver: Uh, yeah, I got it.\ncaller: I'll send you the link. Did you get it?\nreceiver: It's yours.\ncaller: After you buy a ticket for a million dollars on that site, give us the ID number of the ticket, the pin number.\nreceiver: Why do you have to go all the way to the end?\ncaller: And that's fine, because you have to pay back the money within an hour, and by paying now, you show that when you catch the perpetrator later, the payment method is different, and you show that Kim Seung-joon is not involved in this crime.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah.\ncaller: Let me know when you're done.\nreceiver: I've paid for my order.

We've filed our income tax returns and our expense tax returns, but we haven't earned any income yet because we've been operating for less than a year.\ncaller: In January of next year, we'll be able to file an income tax return because we've been operating for a pig year, but according to our tax returns, it's almost impossible for the bank to refund the income.\ncaller: First of all, let's do some research, and what we found is that this is an all-income tax credit, but it doesn't show any income, but it looks like it's going to come out at 3,000, which is the minimum amount for unemployed people, so we type in all this information on the website, and we look it up, and theoretically, it comes out at 27,700,000.\ncaller: But with the money I have and the additional loan of 3,000, I think it's going to be hard to buy as many houses as I want, so I want to borrow some more.\ncaller: I'm going to go with 2 to 3 percent.\ncaller: We haven't really defined the powerhouse yet, but we want to go to at least 5,000 to 100,000,000 powerhouses.\ncaller: If you go to the bank and talk to them, you have to come to their house and give them an address and do a search, and then you have to know roughly how much they're going to borrow, and it's not that easy to look for a home based on that amount, but you want to know how much you can borrow roughly.\nreceiver: It's true what they say about banks: the borrowing limit is determined by the home equity and the credit rating.\ncaller: Oh, is that so?\nreceiver: So you have to go to the charging station to find out what your credit limit is.\ncaller: Is it possible to borrow more than 3000?\nreceiver: If it's just credit and a pre-owned house, 3,000 is certainly possible.\ncaller: So, yes, we would like to make loans only to banks or accredited institutions that are in the first place, and we want to avoid these kinds of large mortgages, is that possible?\nreceiver: Yes, it's possible in financial sector one.\ncaller: If the battery is good, what's the limit? What's the interest?\nreceiver: The interest rate is 2 to 3 percent, 80 to 90 percent of the full amount, up to 400 million yuan.\ncaller: I can prove my income, and I'm paying a lot of money for health care, but what do I have to prove my income to get a loan?\ncaller: It depends on the limit, so if you submit both the business and the health plan, and you check your financials, can you confirm the limit? There's an expectation, but we've almost paid it all.\ncaller: I've got my name on your business license, and I'm in business now.\ncaller: Then I'll prepare the paperwork, including business registration, financial statements, application forms, and a worldwide charter agreement, and then I'll apply.\ncaller: Can we get the results back on the same day?\ncaller: You're welcome to do the autopsy with me.\ncaller: Do you think it's possible for a husband and wife to share the same name?\ncaller: It's a copy, is it?\ncaller: So the loan and the mortgage have to be identical, but can they be co-signed?\ncaller: Yes thank you.

Is it possible to know the exact interest rate in a currency right now?\nreceiver: We have to look at it.\ncaller: Do banks have different eligibility requirements, interest rates, and so on?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So I don't know what's available at all the banks just by looking at it.\ncaller: So what can we learn from a phone call, roughly the terms and conditions, the guidelines, the sequence of pre-tax loans, once we've identified the house?\nreceiver: Yes, you can apply after you've checked out the house.\ncaller: So I've heard that when I look at the 200 billionth of the full set, it's up to 80 percent of the eighty pros, but could it be smaller than that?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: We're going to have to move quickly, and I want to know how long the trial is, because if it's too long, we might not be able to keep up with the schedule.\nreceiver: You can imagine that.\ncaller: Do you repay the principal with interest in the middle, or do you pay the principal later?\nreceiver: Two years over this year, that's the payback.\ncaller: What if we extend the contract? If we only have to pay it back for two years, we won't be able to extend the lease plus the lease. What if we don't have a major credit problem?\nreceiver: Yes, it does.\ncaller: The other banks that I've looked at, when they extend, they have a 10 percent or 10 percent reimbursement policy, but what about here?\nreceiver: There's no such condition.\ncaller: Could it be that your credit rating is so bad that you can't renew it?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: If you get a pre-tax loan, whose account does it go into? Is it the borrower's account?\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: Are you the owner's manager?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Could the interest rate go up when you renew your contract after two years?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Oh, yeah, that's unpredictable right now, but do you have the documents you need to apply for a loan, like a mortgage plus taxes, a contract, an ID, an order?\nreceiver: Yes, we need a copy.\ncaller: Is it possible for my husband to buy the world's medicine and get a loan in my name?\nreceiver: It's not possible.\ncaller: Is it possible for us to set the date, or does the bank do it?\nreceiver: You can choose.\ncaller: Is it possible to get a pre-tax loan even if you're not a commercial bank, or is it only a commercial bank?\nreceiver: It doesn't matter.\ncaller: A: Thank you so much for your kindness in consulting with me, and for your response, which was very informative and not very accurate, but it helped me a lot in deciding whether to take out a loan.\nreceiver: Yes, I can help you.

It used to be three years, it was reduced to two years, and since 2008, it's one year.\ncaller: No, I don't know exactly because I'm exempt from the military, but the country that is Taiwan right now is probably a little loose in our society about this part of the war that we don't understand, the Third World War or something, so I think this conscription system is going to be abolished, so I don' t think it's bad, but whenever and wherever this war or something else comes up, I think everyone will stand up for the country, because there is no conscription system called soldier itself, and I think it' s good, because it' s a profession, rather, as far as I know, the conscription system in Taiwan is not the first, but it starts with someone following, so what do you think about the abolition of this part eventually?\nreceiver: This time the conscription has been abolished, but the military training should continue for four months. Is it not a bit like Israel, where all the men and women receive military training for two months? In our country, only men go to the army, but in Israel, women also go and all the people are always ready for full military force. In Taiwan, instead of conscription, so we can change the conscription to recruit soldiers.\ncaller: I'm in favor of the idea that some people end up being part of a profession, but in some areas, there are people who are uniquely suited to that profession, and there are those who aren't, and even now, because it's a military profession, even if it's not, it's compulsory to go to it, because we're at a turning point in our lives, and things can get worse or better, and this edge of the military, this pressure of being in the military, I think is a little bit burdensome for me, so when you look at it as a profession, and when you see that it's now turned into a recruitment system, I am in favor of it.\nreceiver: I don't know what kind of country we have that has conscription now, but I think it's probably our country, Israel, Taiwan, and I think most countries have conscription, France, the United States, Japan, all of them.

Even if I spend $60,000, sometimes it's not enough. It's not even enough for two weeks.

You know, you're 65 now, but you don't really retire until you're 70, unless you have a health problem, or you have a special reason, and if you say you're not going to retire until your 70s, then I think that's irrelevant, but what do you think in an age of aging?\nreceiver: We're getting older, we're not having as many children as we are, and I think we're getting closer to the age of old age, which I think is an inevitable phenomenon as the world progresses, and I don't want to think too badly about it, but I think it's better to think a little bit more about policies for the elderly or ways to help the elderly, and help them effectively, and I'm just a great-grandmother, who's 80 years old now, and so I've been thinking a lot about whether it might be a good idea to have a little more regulation and a little more retirement age, and how do we get more accurate information about the welfare of the elderly?\ncaller: I think the most effective thing for young people now is that teachers in schools are promoting it, and for people in their 20s or something like that, there's community service, and through that service, you know, the service to help the elderly, the service in places like welfare, and I think the biggest thing you can do is promote it in schools, because I'm a high school student, and I didn't know that the ageing era was so close, and our country is now at the top of the rankings, and it's the first time we've done that today, so I think schools should be teaching a lot about this modern age, so one of the ways to improve the ageing age is to say that women should have more babies.\nreceiver: I don't really like the idea of giving birth, because when women have lots of babies, there's a lot of things that are bad for their bodies, and the only way to deal with that is to have lots of children, but I also have a lot of negative thoughts about giving birth, so I think it's good to have adoption abroad, but I think it doesn't make adoption recognizable, so it's a little bit more legal, and I think we should have more of these kinds of campaigns to raise awareness about adoption, and what do you think about adoption?\ncaller: I don't think about adoption very much, I think it's just natural, and I think a lot of the things that we see in front of us are now commonplace, and we're seeing a lot of them now, and I'm not so negative about adoption.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I've never had a bank lock me up and ask me to unlock a Human account, and I've just been told no?\ncaller: Why didn't you say so?\nreceiver: That's the reason I asked you to bring it, because I'm not doing it, and I can't open a wallet.\ncaller: Are you currently on leave?\nreceiver: I've been in business for a long time, and if you don't work, you can't create.\ncaller: Oh, and now, for example, with the tightening of the money order laws these days, do you have any openings at that cacao bank, any account numbers?\nreceiver: I don't know about that, but I know it happened.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: I think it was issued, and I've never used a cacao card since.\ncaller: Well, then you've never made a deal.\nreceiver: Yeah, I've never dealt with that.

There's fifty-two thousand, three hundred and forty-eight yuan in the receipt.\ncaller: What's the check?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You don't have anything on that Human account?\nreceiver: It has four zeros in it.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: The deposit.\ncaller: Yeah, well, if that's the case, the Bank of the Straits is...\nreceiver: I have $300,000 in a secured loan.\ncaller: Oh, yeah, yeah, so you don't have any form of property rights in the Gulf Bank?\nreceiver: The Straits?\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: I don't have an example.\ncaller: Yeah, yeah.

I read an article recently about a Filipino refugee who saved our citizenship and gained permanent residency in our country, but it's not permanent residence, it's no right of the people, and I'm very uncomfortable about this, and I thought, well, how can you get a refugee to become a permanent resident of the people of a country?\ncaller: I think that in order for a refugee to get permanent residency in that country, they have to first be tested on their ability to understand that country's culture and be able to become a citizen of that country, and so in order for us to accept foreigners who are assimilating, we have to go through a series of tests, like we have to have an understanding of that country and we have to live in that country for a long time and get used to that culture, but we have to give them the right to reside permanently, and if we just help our own people and give them a right to live in our country, there will be social problems.\nreceiver: Well, I don't think I've ever thought about that when it comes to refugees from other countries, but what I'm thinking about is that there's a lot of inequality and a lot of rights that are denied to refugees because they're not citizens of the people, and there's also a lot of injustice that comes with being a citizen of the people and the difficulty of getting a job, and I've heard that refugees work in sweatshops, and the commute is basically two or three hours by train, and I think that's what makes it hard for these people, and I hope that one day soon, these people will find a sense of belonging, a sense of ownership, and they'll be able to live with a little less pain in their lives.\ncaller: I've never seen a refugee, but I've seen someone who has a similar identity to a refugee who later gained permanent residency in our country. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend whose father had come to our country from Mongolia and had applied for permanent residence in our country as a refugee. And when I saw the cultural differences that he and his friend experienced when he was a child, and the difficulties that he had, I think it affected a lot of what I think about the refugee problem, because they also had a hard time coming to our country, because there were economic problems or there might be a war in another country, and so I think we should be able to help those refugees, and I haven't met a lot of refugees in the past, but if I ever meet one, I want to help them understand how they can adapt to living in our country, and if I can help them, then I think that if there's some form of refugee-related cultural work that comes out,\nreceiver: Well, when I think about the stories about refugees, which are usually narrated in the form of novels or documentaries, it's like this housewife who came to Korea a few years ago and lives like this, and she came to Korea and met her husband, who, and how do they live, and how did they come back, what kind of life do they have, and what kind of difficulties do they have.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

you know anything about this bank statement that was found at the crime scene?\ncaller: What do you mean, you know about the ledger?\nreceiver: I was wondering if you knew anything about this ledger found at the crime scene.\nreceiver: There's a receipt, there's an receipt, but what do you know?\ncaller: So, I'm going to ask you if you know anything about this account because it's confirmed that it was opened in your name.\nreceiver: So what do we do now?\ncaller: Are you saying that you had no knowledge of this account?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You didn't know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're telling me that you don't know anything about irrigation, and you have no idea about the tollbooths.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So, instead of treating you like a fraudster and giving you a call, you're looking at yourself as a victim, but you don't have the evidence to prove it, so you're giving me a call to get your statement.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You can't just do it, you know, or you don't know, but you can only make an honest statement.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Do you understand me?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: The reason I'm calling you today is to find out if you're the one who opened this bank account and gave illegal funds to a man named Rainwater.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm trying to find out if you're the victim of identity theft, or if your personal information was leaked without your knowledge.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: This case involves not only Choi Jong-min, but about 200 people nationwide, so there are more victims than perpetrators.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: First of all, we're issuing a subpoena to anyone who has received illegal funds from someone called Ravenscraig, or Ravenscraigh, or anyone else who has money in their pocket, and we're putting them under investigation.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: We have conducted a preliminary investigation, but since there is no precedent in the case of Mr. Choi Jin-min, and no specific allegations have been found, we are conducting a thorough investigation.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: That's why I need you to be as honest as you know how.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Don't worry too much, I'm going to ask you a question, and you're only allowed to say what you know.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm going to tell you a little bit about that incident, but have you ever heard of the Newark Old Country Cafe?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Have you ever heard of it?\nreceiver: I've heard of it.\ncaller: Well, have you tried it?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: You haven't used it, but do you know what it is?\nreceiver: I've heard it in your attic.\ncaller: Well, that Newark antique cafe, where this rainstorm and these organizers are putting up some high-priced fake goods in bulk.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: He deposited the funds into the account of a bank named after Choi Jong-min, withdrew the funds, and now he's on the run.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Because he didn't send the goods, the victim had a total of nine minutes.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And there's been a little damage fund of 23 million won.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Because of the damage caused by that personal wire transfer, the victims are now facing a lawsuit, a complaint, an indictment on account of this one bank wire transfer scam.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But if you didn't open the alert, you wouldn't be able to see the damage.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You're a little more understanding now, aren't you?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: So the most important part of this is that we need to investigate whether or not you're a fraud or a victim today.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We're not treating you like a fraud, and we're not investigating you, so I'm going to go ahead and make a recording of what you said to the first officer, so that it fits the format.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The original recording will be used to certify you as a victim, and there's a trial next week, and I'm going to present some evidence to the court next week.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Is there something you don't understand?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: You're wondering or you don't understand.\nreceiver: No. Do you have to record it?\ncaller: Say that again.\nreceiver: Is that why you need to record it?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Yeah, what can I do?\ncaller: I'm going to explain what I said in the first part, but what's your house?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Do you live alone with your child?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Excuse me, can I ask you how old your son is?\nreceiver: Yeah, what do you need it for?\ncaller:

have any legal effect, so I'm just saying, and if they're too young, they might cry now, so if you don't mind, I'll ask.\nreceiver: She's not that young, but I'm sorry.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'm sorry someone rang the bell earlier, but if you could just text me a brief summary, I'll get back to you.\ncaller: We can't do that, and we can't give you guys any more time to investigate, and I'm kind of busy...\nreceiver: Yes, I'll call you at the number you gave me.\ncaller: No, I can't give you the exact time, because there are so many other investigators.\nreceiver: Well, then what do we do?

It took about a week the last time, and now I have to wait another week?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was on the bus because I didn't take a picture?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I make a new one and I get the card, does the card come to my home or does it come to my office?\nreceiver: Both are possible.\ncaller: If you want to use a transit card, can you get a card and use it immediately?\ncaller: Is there a limit to the use of a transit card?\ncaller: If you have multiple cards in your wallet, is there a chance it won't be printed?\ncaller: Is the payment in advance or in arrears?\nreceiver: It's an afterthought.\ncaller: So it's a one-time payment for a month's worth of tickets?\ncaller: And on the website, there's a shopping service that gives you a discount if you buy more than 5,000 rupees a month.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: This isn't a separate application, so I'm just supposed to write it?\ncaller: The mall was set up, but 12th Street and Jun Market are the only ones available, right?\ncaller: The monthly discount limit is 10,000, but you can't discount more than that.\ncaller: Are there any restrictions on what I can buy, whether it's clothes or books or whatever I'm buying in the mall?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: My card is also a reassurance service, right?\ncaller: I do a lot of shopping every month, so can you give me a discount?\nreceiver: Yes, it is impossible.\ncaller: It's a little weaker than other bank cards.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: The other four cards have a lot of benefits and a lot of perks.\nreceiver: Thank you for your valuable comments.\ncaller: Yeah, and in addition to my card service, I also have a cell phone repair service, so is that a personal expense?\ncaller: How much is it?\nreceiver: It is 30,000 yuan.\ncaller: Even though I didn't do anything wrong, do I have to pay for it myself?\nreceiver: Yes, it does.\ncaller: The reward limit is only 100,000 won, right?\ncaller: Overall, card support is a little weak.\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: Is the support different for each card?\ncaller: What's the card with the most extras?\nreceiver: This is a PLUS card.\ncaller: Is that a transit card service?\nreceiver: So that's a yes.\ncaller: Do you have any shopping support?\ncaller: Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you, and maybe I'll compare it to other cards, but I don't really like it.\nreceiver: I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I mean, my husband has a house, and he has a cat, and he loves that cat so much, and the truth is, I think he doesn't know how to love it, because unlike dogs, cats are solitary animals, but still, when you have people, you have to live on your own.\ncaller: I don't have it anymore. I used to have a puppy called Sichu, and it was really cute. I had it for over 10 years, and then I had to take it to school, and I took it to my aunt's house, and I gave it to her, and after that I heard that the puppy got sick and died.\nreceiver: I don't think I'd want to be responsible for my pets, and I'm not sure I would want to be so responsible, but my husband has a cute cat that I see all the time, and that's why I didn't think about having a pet before, but if I did, I think it would be better to have a cat than a dog.\ncaller: I recently saw on TV a guy who was raising a deer in a tiny container, and it doesn't seem like there's a lot of hands on it, so if you really want to raise a deer, you have to keep the kind of clean animals that you would have if you didn't have to go around the house like a deer and only clean your own house, and only clean inside your own house. In fact, I think it would be very stressful if you had two children, a boyfriend, and even a pet, and now you have a heart, but you can't raise a puppy, and you have to accept one more family, and that's why this feeling of being responsible until the end is so overwhelming, and it's not working.\nreceiver: When I was a kid, I lived in a house, so I had a puppy, and the puppy grew up and had puppies, and then she had more puppies than one, and then the mother dog didn't suckle, and then her mother gave the puppies a bottle of milk at dawn, and I think she would feed the puppies by biting the bottle, and they would give it to other people, and then some of the puppies would eat their tails, and some of them would die, and that's what I remember most sadly, and then when I was a little bit older, I had a frog, not a pet, and it looked like it was crying when it was separated from the frog, and I remember looking at the dog's eyes and crying a lot, and then I thought, I don't want to have any more puppies.\ncaller: I think there are people who, well, they have a dog or a cat in their family, but they don't have a dog, and they think it's just like watching an animal in a zoo, and so, for example, if you go swimming at the beach, and the dogs come and swim with you, the breeders will think that it's good for the dog to swim, and I think there's going to be some people who are against that, and I'm actually against that, because there's also going to be people who are allergic, and they're going to look at it differently than other people, or they'll look at it a little bit differently, or they will naturally do something about it, so I think it'll be unhealthy, but it's a very small sample, and there's a lot of people who don't like it, and the owners of those breeds are their own family, so there's some part of them that they may not like as much as the rest of you, so I'm sure there's at least some examples of breeders who would like to have a dog in their\nreceiver: I wish that I hadn't thrown it away, but I think that's the wrong way to think about it, that you're not raising a dog or a cat because you really want to show off, and I get angry a lot of the time, and if I thought about raising them, I would like to keep them until they die, until they're really old, and they're old dogs, and they have Alzheimer's, and I heard that in our country, they put them to death after a certain amount of time, and so I thought, if I ever do, I'd like to take a dog, or a cat, and raise them instead of breeding them in a shop, so I would like people to start thinking that when they raise pets, they're going to take responsibility all the way.\ncaller: If you see someone abusing an animal, you're going to stop them and report them, because they're only abusing animals, and if they're abusing people, they're probably abusing people and they're also abusing living animals, and it's really bad, and every time you see a video of someone abusing animals on YouTube or in the news, you think, \"How could someone do that?\" or \"Why would they do that?\"\nreceiver: When you see people who have a lot of pets, you wonder why they're keeping so many if they can't afford to do it themselves, and if you want to share the responsibility for their pets, whether it's the ransom, or the vaccinations, or whatever, you're either going to put them in a shelter for them, or you're going to ask other people around you for help, and you're just going to have to give them to them, and it's not because you feel sorry for them that you're bringing them in.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Do you believe in lifelong relationships?\ncaller: I've heard it said that love between a man and a woman has a three-year shelf life, and I think I'm right, so I think there's no such thing as a lifelong relationship, because I think men fall out of love and women fall out and then break up.\nreceiver: I'm thinking about getting married, but whether I do or not, I'm still thinking about my late 30s, mid-30s, because there's a part of me that thinks that getting married takes up so much of my time that I think it's important to have one of those moments where I travel a lot with my friends and have some alone time before I get married, so I'm going to get married, but I'm slowly thinking about what kind of dating style I want to have.\ncaller: And the kind of relationship that I want to have is a friend-type relationship, a friend-like relationship, where you're not attached to each other, you're respectful of each other, and I call it a friend-style relationship, because I don't want to make any more friends that I'm going to lose like I did last time, and I would like to have a friend-kind relationship, and I'd like you to take care of each other a lot, so I would also like to be friends-kind of relationship, where there's no sudden relationship, and you said you're married, and you're planning to have a baby.\nreceiver: In fact, when I was a kid, I wanted to have a baby, but I don't really know how painful it is to have a child, but it's kind of predictable, and I think I can't handle it, and now the hard part about being a student is that I'm going to have to live in a world that I can' t even predict, and my next generation of babies are going to have a hard time with, so I don' t want to have babies, and in high school, I thought a lot about how it would be if I didn' t have babies and adopted them, but if I was old enough and had the financial resources to do it, I thought about adoption.\ncaller: I don't think I'm going to get married yet, because, as I said before, I'm not a believer in a lifelong relationship, and if I want to get married, the process is complicated, and I honestly don't trust the other person, and I think in about three years, I probably won't even believe them, and then when I get married, there's all these problems that come with having a baby, and I'm on the non-contract side, and I really don't want to be married, because if I have a baby, the next 20 years, when the baby grows up, I'll be the caregiver that I have to protect, and I won't be able to take care of myself, and I wonder if I can take care of the baby, and those 20 years, I want to spend for myself, and even that money, I'd rather spend for me, and the pain and the aftermath of having a baby is a lot, and I can't even handle it, and when I have a child, I feel like I might be making a bad choice, and I wouldn't even want to get\nreceiver: Well, I'm in the Dutch-pay business, and I think that if we both make money, then we should be Dutch-paying, and if we only spend money on one side, then I think we should be spending 70 to 30 percent.

I've had Dutch-pay with all my friends since I was a kid, and I don't really think about having a lot of money, so it's too stressful for one side, and I feel like I have to buy it because I'm so sorry if I think the other side is spending all the money and I'm not, so I kind of feel like I'm going to write it all down, and I just want to make sure that I'm wearing Dutch-pay when I'm dating and I want my girlfriend to be wearing it when she's dating.\ncaller: I would like my girlfriend to wear the boyfriend look that people commonly refer to as a boyfriend look, and I think a boyfriend look is when you're wearing it lightly, you're thinking of the casual look of a man-in-the-middle with jeans and beige pants on top of it, and when you are wearing it, you'd like to see him in a white shirt and jeans and slacks, and also when you want to see a slightly blurry look, you might want to see him wearing something like a nightgown, which I think is really cool, because when you go out on a date, there are a lot of couples' items, like a couple's look or a pair's look, and what are the couple's items you want to match?\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

So I went back to Sean again, and I said, 'Hey, this isn't going to work,' and he said, 'I think it's not going to work.' And he told me, 'You're going to tell me,' so I said, \"'Hey, you're okay,' and I told him, 'I'm going to tell you,' and he says, 'We've been skating hand-in-hand with me for a while.' And then after that, he practiced like that, and his performance didn't improve.\ncaller: No, I remember you didn't tell Sean when we first got together, and then I couldn't get on, and I still can't get you to stand up, and I'm still trying to stand up. I just couldn't move my feet. I'm a di, and then you gave me an A, and then name1 and name2 are just like a skating rink.\nreceiver: That's right, that's right. I thought I was talking to my son, but I heard you, so I remember you telling me to be quiet, to be quiet. Oh, and besides, there was something else that was fun.\ncaller: I just thought we were going to some industrial place and stuff like that, and then I was going to some industry place, and you said that name3 was going to go to me first, and then you said, let's go to some industry places, and he was writing songs, and then he was really, really, really writing songs. I thought, yeah, so I want to write my own songs, but there was that music thing, and I was supposed to teach you how to write songs there, and no, he didn't tell me, but honestly, when I was in high school, we had a sign on the bulletin board, and there was something written on it, and I didn't see it, but how he saw it, and then there was this song, and he said, \"You don't want to bake bread, do you?\" And I said, \"I'll make my own bread, and I'll show you, it's kind of cool, you know, if you're going to have a name4 at first, you've got to make your own coffee, you know what I'm saying, you're gonna make your own food, and you'\nreceiver: Yeah, I guess I didn't really go to the industry either, but, uh, there weren't a lot of real pancakes, and there was a lot of bacon, and I don't remember baking in the bay, but the pancakes were better there, they were better, and the silver pancakes we had were something like one of us was too wild, and one of us wasn't flexible, and we didn't have a lot of beds, and there were not a lot of kids, and there wasn't really a place for us to go to the pancake.\ncaller: But I think I've definitely realized the importance of wearing a real suit, because when I was a kid, I didn't know why I had to wear a suit, and I said, \"You can't just wear a suit\", but I'm really, really, really there, and I'm in the industry, and I definitely feel that sense of belonging that comes from wearing a suit, because it's really, really different, and I don't have to wear it, and I really feel that it's very important to have a real suit. And now that I'm a college student, I still don't understand what it means to have a suit in college, and I would love to have something to wear that's so stressful, and a real suit is just a suit with your daughter, and you can wear it like this, but to be honest, I've never worn a suit, but it looks a little bit like that, because she's a little bit older, and she's the prettiest kid, and you know, she's kind of cute, and you'd like to have a nice suit with her, and then you'd remember her\nreceiver: I'm just curious, I was like a pearl in the dirt at first, when I was in the industry, I used to hang out with my name8, but name8 was a little bit weird, but there was a boy there who was a little friendly with name8 and him, but he was also very strange, at first, I know the state where I get along with name8, so we talked about it, and then suddenly he called me, and I wanted to talk to him, but I didn't really know what name8 was, I don't know if it was because he didn't like me, but he liked you, so name8 is talking to me like that, and the guy says to me, he wants to be good with his name8, but he doesn't know what to do, there were a lot of really weird guys in the real industry, and I told him that I called him again.\ncaller: I think you said that to me, but I don't remember what it was.\nreceiver: I don't know what the number is, but it's 010. I think it's not spam. I just got it. It's not my phone. I'm not sure it's real. So I said hello. I was a little embarrassed to say hello. That's why this is not a name10 phone. So I didn't.\ncaller: What's that name 12 doing these days?\nreceiver: I don't know, I think you're not in a relationship, but it happened last time. You weren't supposed to be in a relationship with a girl named name 13, but after you broke up with name 13, you were hurt by a girl you slept with, so you said you weren't in a relationship. Yes, you didn't leave me alone, you suddenly became very close to me, and then you kept saying that you wanted to go out with me, so I went to the car, and then I kept saying that I had a strange girlfriend, so it's not name 6.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Can I help you?\ncaller: I'm confused about my card, and I want to use the mileage, but please let me know how many points I have. I've got my own private + private card that collects miles, and I'm just confused because I don't remember.\nreceiver: (Fifty thousand points) / (Ten thousand points) is confirmed.\ncaller: (50000 points) / ((only eight points) only? Oh, there's more to come. Did you check your name and card correctly? My card number is (1234) / ((day two three) again (5678) / ((eight six seven arms) again (9012) / ((ball work) again (3456) / ((three three eight six) and it's a better plus credit card. There are a few other cards besides this one, so check this one first.\nreceiver: This card is [50000 points] over [0000 points].\ncaller: Recently, I spent a few days in a luxury restaurant and hotel to eat out, and I paid with this card, and I won a national tour event, and I'm traveling, and I spent so much, and it's only worth five thousand points.\ncaller: I've used it a lot, and I know that the more I use it in the terms and conditions, the more points I get, and I don't understand why this is happening.\nreceiver: I'm going to take you to 50,000 points/8,000 points.\ncaller: Uh, how much did you spend? It's just 50,000 points over 10,000 points. The minimum is negative 100,000 points over 100,000 points.\nreceiver: Please confirm your card number.\ncaller: It's going to be 1234 again, and then it'll be 444 again, and it will be 555 again, and so on.\nreceiver: So this is going to be 40000 points over 40000 points.\ncaller: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I had all the points on one card, but I wrote a bunch of these cards together, and then I added up all the sharing cards to get the points, and I'm confused because I'm getting older and my memory is getting worse.\ncaller: So what about the mileage? (1 year) / (one year) or (2 years) / (this year)? I think I've seen it in the pharmacy. I think it's a real memory loss.\ncaller: I know that you can use it in a bookstore, a movie theater, a restaurant, a hotel, etc., but why can't you use an airplane? It would be nice if you could link it to your airline mileage. Can you link this too?\ncaller: (srt) /{STAT} is connected, so why isn't it connected to the airline? If it's connected to a lot of mileage, it saves money and it's easier to use when you're traveling, so why don't you negotiate with the airline and make the plane available?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I asked you before, you said you'd take care of this too, so why don't you always? If you want to help the customer's convenience, you have to check and reflect on these suggestions.\ncaller: How reflective is it? Is it still being negotiated? Is it going to be done by the middle of the year? The answer is yes. You have to reflect these things properly, use them lightly, and put cards around them.\nreceiver: I'll pass it on to the person in charge.\ncaller: If you don't use it by the deadline, you can use it for the next month, and if it's lost, it'll be remembered and used for another month.\ncaller: And if you can keep using the expiration number next year or next month, and the customer remembers that they didn't use it, and it's linked to a card payment, you want to keep using this card, right?\ncaller: And that's good, because the next time you use it, you're going to be able to keep it on schedule, and you're not going to have to make impulse purchases, so you don't have to spend money unnecessarily, and you can help the machine, and I think the sharing card is really better than other card companies in that respect, because the Trump card expired, and for some reason, they didn't want to use it anymore.\nreceiver: Any unused points can be used later.\ncaller: And it's a sharing card, so if my family or friends give me their mileage, can I use it? I usually don't want to use it, or it's annoying, and there's a lot of people around who give out their mileage or lease it, but it's not in the terms and conditions.\nreceiver: Both are possible.\ncaller: Is it really possible? W/sharing cards are very flexible in how they handle these things.\ncaller: You know, when you get a third-party mileage voucher, you ask a lot of these questions, and for some reason, you ask me a lot of questions about when and where and how to use a certain point, and there's a lot of verification procedures, and I get really annoyed when you ask me this and that in the store when you pay, but I'm really glad that you're letting me use this voucher.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: So my card plus someone else's card plus my card or somebody else's cards can all be used together?\ncaller: What if I have multiple shared cards in my name that I can use to overlay my mileage with a (1) / (a) card, and someone else has a shared card mileage that I have legitimate permission to use and their card mileage is linked to my card, and of course I can accrue additional mileage?\ncaller: But there were some places where the use market was in every branch and some places where it wasn't. Why is that? The card company should make it available in all the stores.\ncaller: He really liked his coffee, and he wanted to order a bigger one and give it to her as a gift, and then he had to go to the Trump Hotel and pay for it, and there was a mileage limit, and he couldn't use it all, which was really uncomfortable.\nreceiver: It varies from store to store.\ncaller: So, as much as possible, if the stores are the same, we have to make everything available at all locations, wherever it is, and if it's not, there's a lot of problems with fairness and access. Sometimes when you pay with drive-thru, the kiosk doesn't work, and the sharing card takes a long time to load, and that's a shame.\ncaller: But it's nice to see a little bit of progress from the customer's point of view.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: Well, I'd like to know how much mileage you're getting per month by text message, email, or chat like SNS/SNS, but I think it's discriminatory that people don't come even if they have marketing consent.\ncaller: I'm sorry about that, but I'm also sorry about the letter of introduction, so please do it now when you apply.\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: I would like to inform you by text on the 15th day of each month. No, please send it by email. The message can be mistakenly treated as spam, so the email for Sharing Card is not spam-processed and can be verified by email on the 15 th day of each year. Please send it to 123@.com.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: I'm sorry to bother you with so many questions, but I've always used a sharing card, and I'm sure your mom will think it's annoying because she doesn't have it, so please refer me to the person in charge and help me avoid any inconvenience when using it.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: If you have any further questions about mileage, we'll get back to you.\nreceiver: Thank you.

What is the personality of the other person?\nreceiver: I'm usually a little bit introverted, so when I meet people for the first time, I tend to be a little bit more familiar, but when I'm around people I know, I'm a little bit closer to being an extrovert, so old friends and old acquaintances are often a little bit suspicious that I'm an introvert, but generally, as I get older, I find that these extroverted personalities are more pronounced than these extroverts and introverts.\ncaller: My personality is neither soft nor flexible, it's a little bit straightforward and kind of familiar, and it's not sincere and honest, and I'm not an extrovert, but I'm also not an introvert. I have a sincere and sincere personality, and then I ask you again, what kind of personality do you like or prefer?\nreceiver: Well, when it comes to my personality matches, I tend to prefer a personality that doesn't have a lot of restrictions on me, because usually people, whether they're friends or family, have a tendency to try to change the people around them based on a little bit of their own standards, and because of that tendency, they tend to restrict or interfere or, well, there's a lot of times when I don't really fit in with those personalities, and I tend to get a lot of stress from people who restrict me in that way, and so I tend to try a lot to respect other people based on their personality rather than trying to force my personality on them as much as possible.\ncaller: Well, I'm also making a point about some of the other people's characteristics, and first of all, my characteristics are honesty and sincerity, and I think it's a good thing that I'm the owner of a sexual personality that I can embrace and care for and understand and respect, and that's one of my strengths, and so I'm kind of wondering, and I'm asking myself, what are some of the characteristics of people who are really good, and what are some people who are not so bad?\nreceiver: I'm a self-employed interior designer and architect, and there's a lot of times when I'm making suggestions to other people, like, well, first of all, I'm going to make the best, the most optimal proposal for the people who are going to use the space, and some people are going to be a little bit more open-minded in accepting it, and then there's going to be some people who are a little bit closed-minded about accepting it.\ncaller: Yeah, my flaw is that the other person's job is to do interior design, so I'm a graduate of the National University of Design in Costume Design, and because I'm an expert in clothing, I've heard a lot of times that people in the field of sound design are also architects, and they can accept or push what the interior designers have to offer, so my flaw was that I've had a five-year career as a designer of women's clothing for ladies in the wholesale market, and now I'm working as a web designer for women's clothes for ladies in Shangri-La.\nreceiver: I'm basically very meticulous and honest enough to admit that when it comes to designing an interior, there's a lot of things that have to be checked, checked in advance and checked in the meantime, but because of my personality, of course, I have a little bit of a mental and physical hardship, but on the other hand, because I go through such a difficult process in the middle, the results are very good, even though there are times when this meticulousness and honesty make me feel that these parts are sometimes too exhausting for me to be a flaw.\ncaller: Yes, I was born and grew up in the city of Daegu in the northern part of the country, and I went to high school there, and I lived in Seoul for a long time, and I did a lot of repairs, but the conservative, stubborn, and strong characters in Daegu were so strong that people struggled a lot, so I tried hard to repair those parts of my own body, because I didn't think it would be a good fit for the city of Seoul, so I'm still trying hard to have a character that is sometimes gentle, sometimes flexible, that handles things in all areas efficiently, quickly, accurately, softly, sometimes strongly.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

If our country isn't doing well in terms of employment and our Koreans are losing their jobs because of refugees, then I think I'm just as negative as him, but if we have the capacity and the conditions to accommodate refugees enough, I think of refugees as a cultural development and also as a positive factor.\nreceiver: And as I said before, I think it's good that we live together because we also welcome refugees, and we think there are many good things about being together, but there are also things that make them more joyful, and there are things that can make them more helpful to the development of the country, and if we bring them together with other refugees, they'll like us very much because they're human beings, and more than that, I think now we can use their ideas and reflect on a lot of things, and I think there's a solution to what we can do with refugees who are struggling economically.\ncaller: The solution, I think, is that the state should actively help -- any country can become a refugee, and in this particular case, our country has a higher chance of becoming a refugee than perhaps any other country, and I don't think we're excluding potential refugees, but I think the state should be actively supporting refugee policies, and I think our people should not just look at the negatives, but they should also think about the cultural exchanges, the competitiveness, and they should treat refugees well.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

The name of the product is new, and after analyzing your current loan situation, we have decided that you are eligible to participate in this program.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, how high are we going?\ncaller: If you repay your existing loan, the limit can go up to 30 percent, which is a benefit that's only available if you're repaying your existing loan.\nreceiver: So how do you repay an existing loan?\ncaller: Just deposit your existing loan repayments into our designated bank account, and as soon as the deposit is confirmed, we'll adjust it to the new limit.\nreceiver: Wait, but why can't you just cash it out yourself, using a checking account or an ATM?\ncaller: Oh, it's a little bit complicated, and the program has to follow a procedure that's specifically designed for fast processing, because it's hard to apply new limits immediately when you have a direct refund from the customer, and we have to manage it ourselves, and it's much faster and safer, and of course we can do that, but it's time-consuming and internally complicated.\nreceiver: It's a little weird, but don't they usually ask you to pay them back?\ncaller: Yes, that's right, but this is a special program, so we're going through the general process, which is a little bit different from what we do with our existing products.\nreceiver: So, if I make a deposit, does the limit go up?\ncaller: Yes, to be precise, as soon as the deposit is confirmed, we go through the process of applying the new limit, and once that's done, it's going to be difficult for you to confirm immediately, but the quickest way to do that is the way we're talking about, so it's probably 3:00 p.m. right now, and it'll be deposited into your account by 6:00 at the latest tomorrow, so you don't have to worry too much.\nreceiver: By the way, how did you know which bank I was using?\ncaller: We're trying to provide the best possible service based on your credit history, which you know because you're our customer.\nreceiver: Who are you?\ncaller: I'm a loan officer at the headquarters of Shinhan Bank.\nreceiver: Who is it?\ncaller: It's him.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: I understand that you have some doubts about following this procedure, but in order to give you the fastest and best service, I'm going to call you and introduce you, and if you don't trust us, there's nothing we can do. You have to trust us, and we can help you as conveniently as possible.\nreceiver: I do, but it's just a little weird.\ncaller: We're a bank that puts the safety and security of our customers first, and trust is the foundation of our bank, and you're the only one who's missing out on it, and that's why we're trying to get in touch with you and ask you questions, and we're also trying to give our bank customers benefits first, and after we've done that, we're going to put a recruitment page on the left-hand side, and other customers already have a lot of benefits, so why not take a chance?\nreceiver: Yes, I will.\ncaller: I've been in this department for a long time, and I've never had a product this good, so I'm sorry to keep telling you, but are you uncomfortable?\nreceiver: Oh, thank you.\ncaller: The account number is Shinhan Bank, 449-7541-37256.\nreceiver: What's the next 449?\ncaller: 7541-37256. Did you write it all down?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Repeat what you wrote.\nreceiver: 449-7541-37256 This is Shinhan Bank.\ncaller: Yes, that's right. Can you make the deposit now?\nreceiver: It's 3:30 in the morning.\ncaller: We have to get off work, so you have to deposit at least until 5:00 so we can start the program and get off work so you can be in by mid-morning.\nreceiver: Oh, I'll deposit it by 5:00.\ncaller: And did you mention my name?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: Please write my name again on the piece of paper where you wrote your account number.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: When you've made your deposit, call me back at this number and tell me you're looking for a loan officer, and I'll take care of the rest.\nreceiver: Yeah, I was wondering what the name of the depositor is when you make a deposit.\ncaller: It's going to be called a new bank account for newbies.\nreceiver: What's new is the name of this product?\ncaller: Yeah, I told you at the beginning.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, the novelty.\ncaller: Yeah, well, make sure you're done with the deposit by 5:00 and call me back.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.

classify: <conversation>\nreceiver: name1 if there's one job that you've done that you particularly remember, what is it and why?\ncaller: Well, I've done work in cafes and restaurants, and if you want to say it's particularly memorable, I was a visiting teacher who came to my children's homes to teach them how to draw, which is not very common, I think it's especially memorable.\nreceiver: Well, I guess I'm a little bit like that, because I did an internship at a kid's cafe that runs somewhere like HomePlus, and I used to be an elementary school teacher, and I had a dream, and I liked kids a little bit, and I loved to play with them, and I really liked that kind of stuff, and so, oh, well, then it turns out that I was looking for something that I liked, and it was the kid's café internship, and I did it for a very short period of time, but it was a very short-term internship where I was just filling people up, and I was doing it for two weeks, and during that time, I was playing with the kids, and then the kids were thinking about something else, and I came to do a little bit of work, but I think it was especially good because it made me feel like I was hiking.\ncaller: Well, this was when I was working at a restaurant, and now it's in an apartment building, and there's so many adults and babies, and I see that the adults don't talk much, and in the case of babies, they keep running and yelling, and it's like this, and I think it was a little difficult to manage, and then the boss had a very bad boss, and all my friends who were working with me at the time, and I had that experience where the four of us went through a little bit of a bad thing, and then we quit again, and it was a very bad memory.\nreceiver: Yeah, I was a parking valet, and now I'm a parking attendant, and I was also doing parking valet at a place that I was going to for the first time, and it was a housewarming event, and I had just built a new house, and I didn't have a lot of maps, so they didn't give me that information, and I really didn't know the geography, and people were always asking me questions like, what is the number of blocks, where are the blocks, and I think it was hard because every time I couldn't answer the right question to the question, and I thought maybe it was a little bit personal, but it wasn't because someone was bullying me or something was wrong with me, it was because I felt a little bit that I wasn't doing my job properly.\ncaller: I'm a painter by training, and this is something that I already have, but it's probably a little hot these days, so it's a little hard to do it outdoors if you're traveling for a long time, so I got a commission from home, and I thought maybe it could help me improve my skills and have a positive impact on each other, so I thought I'd give it a try.\nreceiver: Well, I'm an art major myself, so I think it's a little bit like that, but actually, this is the kind of algebra that we already have, and, well, actually, when you're doing art work, you need to work a little bit on yourself, and I don't think you can do all the work on one piece of art, and I think that's the kind of art that you can't do the whole process on, so it's kind of a simple thing, and I've heard that you can do it with a little bit more than one person, and that's why I wanted to do some algebra in that area, because I was interested in the field a little bit, and I also wanted to do a little bit of algebra in this area, and I wanted to go to some exhibitions or something like that, and explain a little bit about it.\ncaller: I don't think I've had that much experience with Alba, and the longest I've ever had it is because, as I said before, I was a one-on-one home-schooling Alba, and I didn't have much of a special relationship with a friend from high school, but he wasn't really a friend at all, and I think it's a good memory for me to have stayed friends with him, because I've developed a little bit of a bond with him, and we've been eating together, and I've made a lot of memories.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm a little bit like that, but it's one of the things that I remember about my friends who did artwork with me, and I did a mural artwork once, and it wasn't really a big project, it was just a small project, not a public agency or something, it was a mural project that a private person had asked me to do, and I was there with some of the guys, and then some of the kids, and I think it kind of stuck in my memory, because I was so close, and I only knew one person, and I got dragged there, and we were really close, but then I looked back and it felt so good, because I really liked that feeling of being close to people that I didn't know, drinking and talking and stuff, and I thought, well, you know, I'll be doing artwork again, and now I'm looking for a little bit of artwork or something, and I've got a few of these confirmed artworks.\ncaller: I love music and I love the atmosphere, so I've been looking for a lot of coffee shops, and now, last week, I've got one, so I have been working since last week, and I think it's really good for me to make coffee and listen to my favorite music, and it's good for me, so I later dreamed of building a coffee shop where I could listen to my favourite music, paint my favourite paintings, drink my favourite coffee, and I'm doing coffee shops right now, but I'm on a very short-term contract, so I am trying to find more coffee shops that I can do in the morning.\nreceiver: Now, the thing I'd like to do right now is go to the art room, which I've mentioned before, but I'm kind of interested in pure art, like ceramic art, or glass art in particular, so I'm going to go to this art room and learn a little bit of craft for a while, or maybe I'll do a little bit with you, and since we don't have that kind of craft in our school, if you don't want to come up later because it's an online class, but if you're going up later, there's this kind of thing that I would like to try and do.\ncaller: In my case, Mr. name2, as Mr. name2 said, I used to be a mural artist, and I used to teach classes, and I'm sure that if I do that, now when I start working, I get a little bit scared, and I don't know what to do, and I often feel stupid, because I'm working with an artificial self-care, I think I could have done it a little bit easier, and I could have handled it comfortably, and I thought it was nice to be able to work with something I like and do well and make a profit from it.\nreceiver: And I'm particularly fond of the idea of Arbit, which is that you're a member of something, and you're doing it, and I wanted to try and sell some of it myself, and I actually did that in college, and it was just for an event or a business, but we're making our own Keelings, and we're going to sell them, and so it's kind of hard to think of an Arbit, but there's a little bit of a difficulty in the idea of creating a Keelings that way, and then we'll put it on the film market and sell it to a bunch of students and we'll promote it ourselves, and of course we'll do all the things that we've done, but most of the things we've been doing, we've just done the basic promotions at school, and we just made a petticoat, and how do we sell it, and that's sort of a college-level thing, but I've seen Arbit, and I think that's the most memorable thing about Arbit, if you've ever heard of it, is that you didn't go\ncaller: Well, I went to high school at this high school, and once a year, it was called the Yale Fair, and we had this event where we made the whole school into a gallery, and we exhibited the paintings, and we sold the goodies, and things like that, and so for three years, I participated in that, and I sold these and these paintings of mine, and little baby items that I had made with my friends, and then one of my friends had a dream of being an illustrator, and he went to the Seoul Illustrator Fair, and I went to see it, and I thought it was cool to take his real paintings and make these things and sell them, and so I haven't done anything like that since I was an adult, but this time, there's an Illustrator Fair in Busan, and I'm thinking about participating in it, and so, well, you know, name two, if you'd like to do it yourself, you might have some experience making and selling something like that.\nreceiver: Yeah, I've never actually made anything of my own, other than that film market, and I've been doing this sort of thing in college where I'm always exhibiting, and we're in a design class, so the work is usually not three-dimensional, but it's visual design, so it's mostly printed work that comes out flat, and it's not like printing something or anything, but I remember having a little bit of fun with that kind of exhibition, and still working on it, so now I'm going to ask you one last question.\ncaller: Well, I've been thinking that there's only one way to do it ever since I came into this world, and actually, when I was a kid, I used to say, \"Oh, I'm going to be a painter\", a lot, but I've actually been pursuing that, and because I'm majoring in Westernization, I hope I don't end up being a painter, and as I said before, my dream is to build a cafe where I can use my favorite coffee and coffee and music, and I'll do the interior design myself, and then I'll get a job like this, and work from there.\nreceiver: Oh yeah, that's the kind of painting I was dreaming about, because I was studying art, and I wanted to do a little bit of pure art at first, but it was too hard for me, so I was kind of preparing myself to go into design, because I didn't really know how to fish, but now I'm kind of sexually involved, and I'm able to take that Avon Edbendage with me, and I went into this kind of design, but I had a different kind of fun, and this is kind of like applied art, where you're not just talking to yourself, you're trying to convince other people, and I think there's a bit of a subtle attraction to that.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role":

I'm learning Chinese now, and I've learned a lot about China, and I want to do things in China that I haven't done before, and I think I'm going to enjoy more than ever. And I want to try nail art, because Chinese masks are cheap, and I also want to try a fish dish called kaowi, and I was wondering if people would recognize me when I speak Chinese.\ncaller: I want to go back to Busan, because I went to Busan last time, and I didn't really look at the sights, and I think I ate too much, so I want to take a trip to Busan again, and I want to visit the famous sights again, and then I want to try some other foods besides the food I ate last time, because I've made plans to go on a trip after the coronavirus is over.\nreceiver: Yeah, I want to be the first one to go to Portugal when the coronavirus is over, and this time I found some travel YouTubers, and they went to Portugal, and there's some real scenery that I'm seeing for the first time, and it's totally western, and it feels like this, and I want to go there, and if I go to Portugal, I also want to go to Spain, which is right next door, and I don't know exactly what's famous in Spain, but I just feel like I have to go there because I want to.\ncaller: Yeah, I like to go and see what's more famous in the country before I go on a trip, so I can plan it well, and I know where I'm going, so I think it saves me a little bit more time, and if I go and see the sights in advance, I don't want to miss the sights, so I make sure to find out what's famous in the place before I go.\nreceiver: I haven't traveled so much yet, so I don't really know who I'm going with. It's not like it's something that's set in stone, but I think it's a little more comfortable to go with friends than family. If I go with my family, I'll be a little tired because I have to look for tourist maps and think about where I should go with my parents and whether it's going to be to my liking.\ncaller: I've never been to Ganglun, but I've been to the railway station because my brother was in the army, so I don't have to go to the railroad station. I'd like to go to Ganglun once. What's famous in Gabon Ganglun?\nreceiver: Yeah, I skied there in the winter of 2016, before I started high school, and then I went to Seoul with my aunt Kim and my cousin and my brothers, and it was really cold, and my head is so cold that I don't want to go there again.\ncaller: I like to eat well, but I like to see a little bit more, because I think that eating is similar and similar, so I think it's better to see than to eat, and the last time I traveled to Busan, I only ate so much, something was wrong, so I'm looking for a little more sightseeing.\nreceiver: When I go, I think it's three or four days, but these days I want to live in the area a little bit, three or four is too short for me, so I'd rather see the sights than just the roads and things like that, so I think a week or two is better, so the next time I go to China or Portugal or whatever, I'd like to go back and forth for a week or more, and if I'm going to China, I would like to live in China for a month or so, you know, when you're planning your trip, you have to be thorough.\ncaller: I feel like I'm not being thorough when I'm planning a trip, and I'm trying to be thorough, and then I'm looking for tourist attractions, and finding out what kind of bus or taxi, and it's hard to connect these things, so I don't think I'm being thorough, so I'm just saying that once you've decided where you're going, and you've gotten to that place, and then when you're in that place, you look at the situation, and you change your destination, and then you travel, and I think that being able to travel thoroughly is really hard, and if you want to travel comprehensively, it's good to go on a package trip, and the biggest disadvantage of traveling is thinking about the disadvantages and advantages.\nreceiver: The biggest disadvantage is that we spend a lot of money because we don't really have a job, we make money, so it's hard to make money, but when you travel, you spend a little bit of money, and that's the biggest disadvantages, I think, and the biggest advantage is that you think of travel as an experience, and when you go on a trip, you might find yourself in a situation that you've never been in before, and you go to a place that no one knows, and you have to do it on your own, and you think, well, wouldn't it be a good experience to have that experience, and it's great to be able to learn about a new culture, and if you could only go to one place, where would you go?\ncaller: I think I'm going to go to Russia, to Russia, and I want to jump into those big eyes, and make a giant snowman, and see a lot of pretty people in Russia, and take a train in Russia, so I'll sleep on the train and eat on the train, and it'll be really fun, and I'm so excited to see how beautiful Russia is.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How much does it cost? It doesn't cost more if the property is expensive.\nreceiver: I'm sorry, but you're a VIP, so the emotional expense is unacceptable.\ncaller: OK, so let's see if we can get a deposit-guaranteed loan, a credit-guarantee loan, a real-estate loan, and it's not going to be more negative than what you just said.\nreceiver: That's not accurate.\ncaller: Is it approximate?

There's more to come. Did you check your name and card correctly? My card number is (1234) / ((day two three) (5678) / ((eight six seven arms) (9012) / ((ball work) (3456) / ((three eight six)) and it's a better plus credit card. There are a few other cards besides this one, so let's check this one first.\nreceiver: This card is [50000 points] over [0000 points].\ncaller: Recently, I spent a few days in a high-end restaurant to eat out, and I paid with this card, and I won a national tour event, and I'm going to travel, and I spent this much, and it's only 50,000 points, don't you understand?\ncaller: I've used it a lot, and I know that the more I use it in the terms and conditions, the more points I get, and I don't understand why this is happening.\nreceiver: I'm going to take you to 50,000 points/8,000 points.\ncaller: How much did you spend on this card? It's only 50,000 points. It's a minimum of 100,000 points. I have another bulletproof credit card.\nreceiver: Please confirm your card number.\ncaller: It's the number of days in a year. It's one day, two days, three days.\nreceiver: So this is going to be 40000 points over 40000 points.\ncaller: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I had all the points on one card, but I wrote a bunch of these cards together, and then I added up all the sharing cards to get the points, and I'm confused because I'm getting older and my memory is getting worse.\ncaller: So what about the mileage? (1 year) / (one year) or (2 years) / (this year)? I think I've seen it in the pharmacy. I think it's a real memory loss.\ncaller: You see the terms and conditions, and you know that you can use it in a bookstore, a movie theater, a restaurant, a hotel, etc., but why can't you use it on an airplane? If you can connect it to airline mileage, that's great, but can you connect it to this?\ncaller: Ordinary transportation is the subway, KTX, SRT, ALT, why can't you connect with the airline? If you connect with a lot of mileage, you can save money and travel more conveniently, but don't you have to negotiate with an airline?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I asked you before, you said you'd take care of this too, so why don't you always do that? If you want to help your customer's convenience, you have to check and reflect on these suggestions.\ncaller: Are you still negotiating? Are you going to be done by the middle of the year? No, no, no. You've got to reflect on these things properly, use them sparingly, write cards around them.\nreceiver: I'll pass it on to the person in charge.\ncaller: If you don't use it by the deadline, you can use it for the next month, and if it's lost, it'll be remembered and used for another month.\ncaller: And if you can keep using the expiration number next year or next month, and the customer remembers that they didn't use it, and it's linked to a card payment, you want to keep using this card, right?\ncaller: And that's a good thing, because the next time you use it, you're going to be able to keep it on schedule, and you're not going to have to spend it on impulse purchases, and it's going to help your household, and I think the Sharing Card is really good in that respect, compared to other card companies, because the Trump Card, when it expires, for whatever reason, you can't use it again, and you don't want to use it.\nreceiver: You can use the unused Ka plus the unused points together next time.\ncaller: And it's a sharing card, so if my family or friends give me their mileage, can I use it? I usually don't want to use it, or it's too much trouble for me to have a mileage allowance or a lease around, but it's not in the terms and conditions.\nreceiver: Both are possible.\ncaller: Is it really possible? W/sharing cards are flexible enough to handle this kind of thing, because you usually ask a lot of questions when you get a third-party mileage.\ncaller: For some reason, I've been asking a lot of questions about when and where and how to use a certain point, and there's a lot of verification procedures, and I get really annoyed when I have to ask this and that in the store when I'm paying, but I'm really glad that you're letting me use this right away.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: So you can use my card or someone else's card together?\ncaller: What if I have multiple shared cards in my name that I can use to overlay my mileage with a (1) / (a) card, and someone else has a shared card mileage that I have legitimate permission to use and their card mileage is linked to my card, and of course I can accrue additional mileage?\ncaller: But there were some places where the use market was in every branch and some places where it wasn't. Why is that? The card company should make it available in all the stores.\ncaller: He really liked his coffee, and he wanted to order a large one and give it to her as a gift, and then he had to go to the Trump Hotel and pay for it, and there was a mileage limit, and I couldn't use it all, which was really uncomfortable.\nreceiver: It varies from store to store.\ncaller: So, as much as possible, if the stores are the same, we have to make it possible for all branches, everywhere, and if not, there are many problems with fairness and access. Sometimes when you pay with drive-thru, the kiosk doesn't work, and the sharing card is loading, plus the loading time is long, and that's a pity.\ncaller: But it's nice to see a little bit of progress from the customer's point of view.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: But if you could send me a monthly mileage estimate via text message, email, or chat like SNS/SNS, would that be helpful? I think it's discriminatory who comes and who doesn't, even if you have marketing consent.\ncaller: I'm sorry about that, but I'm also sorry about the letter of introduction, so please do it now when you apply.\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: I would like to inform you by text on the 15th day of each month. No, please send it by email. The message can be mistakenly treated as spam, so the email for Sharing Card is not spam-processed and can be verified by email on the 15 th day of each year. Please send it to 123@.com.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: I'm sorry to bother you with so many questions, but I've always used a sharing card, and I'm sure your mom will think it's annoying because she doesn't have it, so please refer me to the person in charge and help me avoid any inconvenience when using it.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: If you have any further questions about mileage, we'll get back to you.\nreceiver: Thank you.

If you buy an overcoat today, what would you like to cook?\nreceiver: If you buy a turtleneck and cook, the first thing that comes to mind is the White House because it's hot, but today it's too hot, so it's probably not the White House. I'm going to cook meat with the turtlenecks, the turtledove, the butterbur, and this one. Living in the state, I see a lot of turtlenecked restaurants, and I think it's a bit expensive, but I'd like to know what you think about that price point.\ncaller: And the problem with that is that we've seen a lot of growth in the production of negative news, but it's not really reaching the people who buy it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I feel like I wasted my time for five years.\ncaller: Apply now, and since there's only a few days left in the month, make sure you're ready to start paying next month.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: (Applause) The last time I went to the bank and applied, they even gave me a set of travel toothbrushes, but I don't think there's anything like that on the phone.\nreceiver: Each coffee gift token will be automatically generated and sent to your mobile phone number when you deposit it for a period of two months.\ncaller: Yes. Thank you. And if I have an automatic monthly transfer, can I text you that it's been transferred?\ncaller: (Applause) I don't know if they didn't have that service or if I didn't apply for it, but I never got a letter.\ncaller: One time, I had a big withdrawal and the cash register was empty, and I forgot to deposit it, so I almost didn't get it that month.\ncaller: I was very uncomfortable at the time, but is it possible to have a People's Bank?\nreceiver: I'd like to request that you send me a text message after the monthly auto-transfer is complete.\ncaller: Yes, and I didn't tell you which account I have to withdraw to. I have two accounts in the People's Bank of China, please let me withdraw to one of them.\ncaller: I was about to make a separate deposit, but if I don't make a deposit, does it automatically cancel the deposit?\nreceiver: You can deposit it next month.\ncaller: It's good that other banks are shutting you down if you don't make a deposit, but I think it's great that the NBS is rethinking it from the customer's point of view.\nreceiver: Thank you.\ncaller: And then after 3 years over 3 years, what's the total?\ncaller: It's obviously a tax write-off, but it's probably less than I thought it would be.\ncaller: But when you think about it, it doesn't make sense that I get my salary tax-deductible, and then I have to take my savings tax deductible.\ncaller: You already take tax from your salary, why do you want to take more?\ncaller: I think it's better to put money in the general ledger rather than the ledger, don't you?\nreceiver: It's a certain part of the country.\ncaller: Yes, I know it's pointless that I'm telling you this now, but it's a little bit depressing.\ncaller: But last time I checked, there's some savings that don't get taxed, right?\nreceiver: Yes, there is.\ncaller: So maybe it's better to do it on the side.\nreceiver: If you look at that balance and the current balance and the actual receipts, it's the same amount.\ncaller: So what's the actual amount that I'm going to get? It's okay if it's not the exact amount.\nreceiver: It's about 18 million yuan.\ncaller: Yeah, well, thanks for the heads-up, but I think we might be able to get a little less out of it.\nreceiver: Do you have any other questions?\ncaller: No. No. Thank you so much for recommending a good product and a good service application. Next time, I will only deal with the People's Bank.\nreceiver: Thank you.\nreceiver: She was a member of the People's Bank of China.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Well, you know, your client, your client right now, they're in a situation where they have to go to the IRS.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We've been running loans all over the place on a whim, and we don't have to explain why these reports are going up.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So, if your client has a securities fraud report, it's going to be very difficult for you to get a loan in the future.\nreceiver: But I can't afford to pay 20 or 30 percent.\ncaller: That's why I'm here.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And because of that, we can't do it all with our bank funds.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm going to ask you how much you can get out of our bank-subsidized loans, and if you don't get at least 20 percent, it's going to be 20 percent.\nreceiver: Oh, well, I'm sorry, but I'm just going to pretend that I don't.\ncaller: What's the matter with you?\nreceiver: There's nothing I can do about that right now.\ncaller: Well, if it's 20 percent, then your three-million-pound client won't even process three million.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, I've got money to spend.\ncaller: So this is what we're going to get out of our bank anyway, but this isn't going to work either?\nreceiver: So whether or not I'm going to get reimbursed, I need to be in a position where I can pay for it now.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: That's why I'm telling you.\ncaller: Now then, my client.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: How far are you willing to go?\nreceiver: It's not how much you can do, it's how much you don't want to do.\ncaller: Why do you have a bunch of people that I've seen benefit your clients?\nreceiver: No, but it's a benefit.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I don't know what happened today, but it's because of my ignorance.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Whatever the situation is, I think it's best that I just don't do it.\ncaller: Well, I'm not forcing you, but...\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But if you go to the Treasury, you're going to have a lot of loans coming your way, and when it comes to that, it's hard to get a loan, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do.\nreceiver: I know that.\ncaller: If it's anything else, I won't talk about the Asari Islands, and I'll just say that I'll take care of it today and pay you back tomorrow.\ncaller: If you're 54, 55 years old, you're older.\ncaller: You've got a long life ahead of you.\nreceiver: I know that.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I know, but right now, he's telling me that he's gonna give me $23 million tomorrow.\ncaller: So even if it's not tomorrow, you can ask for some time, and then you ask for time, and you can give me some time.

I'm just so nervous right now.\ncaller: That's why I told you that no therapist is crazy enough to help you like this.\nreceiver: That's enough.\ncaller: And as I said, I'm in the same year as my wife, and I'm trying to help her because I have a wife idea.\nreceiver: Thank you so much.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'm so nervous right now, and I don't think $150,000 is a small amount of money.\ncaller: I know, sir.\nreceiver: And it turns out that today he's a millionaire, and then...\ncaller: The million-dollar bond will be purchased tomorrow, the loan will be paid tomorrow, and in an hour, the million dollar bond will be disbursed from our Relief Department.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And the cost of the bonds on the morrow, which is due tomorrow, is going to be repaid.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: You're very kind, but I'm in a lot of trouble.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: And then you know, right?\ncaller: Yeah, I know that feeling, and I get a lot of shit for negotiating loans on the phone, too, to be honest.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And I want you to understand that part of it, because I only do loans over the phone, isn't it too common for me to call the bank names these days, and that's why we're getting a lot of shit right now, and frankly, we're under a lot of stress.\nreceiver: Oh, really, I'm just thinking that if all the money is gone now, and I'm not going to tell my agent, then it's going to be too hard for me, because life is too uncertain when you think about it.\ncaller: That's what I'm talking about. That's why I'm sending you some ID.\nreceiver: I mean...\ncaller: And if you don't, I'll be the one to report it.\nreceiver: So, what do you say we do the same thing tomorrow?\ncaller: Instead of doing the same thing today, we're going to have to make a request to the receiver.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, you can go to the bank designated by our receiver and take care of it.\nreceiver: Well, it's just like today, you take one from the bank and you put it in a safe because I'm working.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'm off duty now.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'm having a hard time getting out of the office, so I'm gonna take 15 or 20 minutes off today.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, then your client has a post office nearby?\nreceiver: Four post offices are nearby. The post office is the closest.\ncaller: Well, then, I'd like to ask that I be assigned as close as possible to where the client says he wants to go.\nreceiver: Well, since you say so, I'm gonna need it anyway.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: You're a good man, but I've got a big problem, so I can get the loan tomorrow.\ncaller: All right, you buy the bonds, you explain to the treasury, you explain that your client didn't do it maliciously, and then you send it to our headquarters, we verify it with our head office, and we transfer the funds to our branch, $40 million.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So, before we hand over the $40 million to our customers, our payments department will first call your customers to thank you for lending us the money, and instead of paying them back, we'll talk about these things, and then we'll transfer the funds.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'll do that then.\ncaller: Would you please proceed?\nreceiver: Yeah, I'll do that.

How can we monitor more closely and find out in advance what we've done, how can we increase the amount of time we've served and what we haven't served?\ncaller: There's a lot of people who work in the arts and physical education, and there's so many different kinds of people, and we give those benefits to people in all sorts of different kinds of jobs, and I think it's a very holistic, very specific kind of volunteerism that needs to be demanded and submitted, and I hope that in the future, we don't have any more of these false statements that are going to hurt people's lives, or that they're going to be knighted, and other artists are going to be fingered or harmed.\nreceiver: I've never seen anything like it on TV, but when a player reaches the quarter-finals of the World Cup or beyond, and gets his exemption, people around him are jealous or happy enough to see that he's done really well. I've seen articles where one of the players who got his exemption says that his performance in the xx didn't qualify, but he was transferred to the artistic staff, and later he checked his eligibility and canceled it.\ncaller: And I'm wondering if there's something wrong with both of them, and I'm trying to figure out if this is a mistake on either side, or if it's an evasion of responsibility, because there's a mistake, and you're trying to cover it up, and you have to figure out which side is at fault, and I don't think it's the fault of either side.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Please.\ncaller: Yes, and I have two things to verify for your client.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: I was just checking the Pesticide Inventory, which was opened on or about July 10th, 2012, and I was wondering if you'd ever mentioned it.\nreceiver: I don't know what you're talking about.\ncaller: Yes, that's right.\nreceiver: The only thing that's been rebuilt is a national registry.\ncaller: Yes, I see that many of you are saying that you've just opened a farm gate and you've never used it.\nreceiver: No, you should be using it.\ncaller: You're using it now.\nreceiver: You've got your baggage, that's what you have to watch out for.\ncaller: You're saying you're using it normally?\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: Well, then, didn't your client just open an account last month?\nreceiver: You know, I've had enough of that.\ncaller: You're saying you've been here a long time?\nreceiver: It didn't last long.\ncaller: It's not that long ago, and if you look at the transaction records, this woman, Min Hyun-jae, deposited eight hundred and sixty-five thousand yuan into this SCO account.\nreceiver: No, there's no such person.\ncaller: I don't know.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Mr. Ne Min Hyun-ja deposited eight hundred and sixty-five thousand won into this SCO account, and I think Mr. Kim Jae-won was just trying to withdraw these eight hundred and six hundred and fifty thousand won in cash.\nreceiver: That's weird. I don't know who wrote that memo.\ncaller: Do you know who Min Hyeon-jae is?\nreceiver: No, it was a stranger.\ncaller: Then you don't know who deposited it, and neither does Mr. Kim Ji Eun, who wants to withdraw it.\nreceiver: I don't know. I'm that morgue attendant, and I know who I am because I'm talking to you right now.\ncaller: When I saw it, I thought maybe this Kim Jae Woong guy was somewhere stealing your client's personal information and making him into a fake accountant.\nreceiver: No, no, no, wait a minute.

What's the tax rate?\ncaller: So the first house that we're looking at is between 6,000 and 10,000,000 to 1 billion.\nreceiver: What happens to the loan amount?\ncaller: It's somewhere between 4,000 and 8,000.\nreceiver: So you're not done writing the world charter yet?\ncaller: Yeah, I haven't written it yet.\nreceiver: Are you the one who wants to borrow money?\ncaller: It's you.\nreceiver: What's the income going to be?\ncaller: We've been open for less than a year, and we haven't made any money.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, let me know what your monthly payments are for your local health plan.\ncaller: It's about 25 thousand yuan.\nreceiver: What about generations?\ncaller: This is me.\nreceiver: Have you paid more than three months?\ncaller: Yes, he did.\nreceiver: What was your combined credit card and check card usage last year?\ncaller: It's roughly between 1,000 and 20,000 yuan.\nreceiver: Are you under the age of 34 or are you eligible for a polygamous or polygynous family?\ncaller: (34 years old) / (thirty-four years old) or younger and have a preschool child (1 person) / (one person) as a dependent.\nreceiver: What about home ownership?\ncaller: They're homeless.\nreceiver: Have you ever borrowed anything?\ncaller: I have a scholarship loan, and I have a credit union business loan.\nreceiver: What kind of house is it that you're moving into, an apartment, an office, a multi-family home, a condo?\ncaller: We're looking at multi-generational housing or office buildings.\nreceiver: Where are you moving to?\ncaller: This is Seoul.\nreceiver: Do you know your credit score?\ncaller: I was rated 2 out of 3 by the credit union at the time of the loan.\nreceiver: What's the approximate date?\ncaller: It's crazy because the house hasn't been fixed yet.\nreceiver: I've checked your basics, and I was wondering if you could fill me in on the details.\ncaller: As you said, we opened our shop last December/December and we are managing it as a general manager. We have completed the income tax return and the withholding tax return, but we have not received any income yet because we have been operating for less than one year.\ncaller: I know that you can file a tax return next January/January for operating in the year of the pig, but according to your tax returns, it's almost impossible for the bank to refund your income.\ncaller: But first of all, let's do some research, and what we found was a tax-free loan for the elderly, but it doesn't show any income, but it looks like the minimum amount for the unemployed would be $3,000, so we went to the website and searched for this and that, and theoretically, it says $27.7 million.\ncaller: But with the money I have and the additional loan (3000) / ((three thousand)) I think it's going to be hard to get as far as I want, so I'm willing to borrow some more.\ncaller: I'm not quite sure yet, but I'd like to go to at least five thousand, five thousand, ten million, one billion.\ncaller: If you go to the bank and talk to them, they'll come to you from home plus home.\ncaller: I have to put in an address and do a search, and I have to know roughly how many loans I'm going to get, and it's quick to look for a house based on that amount, but I want to know how much I can get, roughly.\nreceiver: It's true what they say, the credit limit is determined by the credit rating.\ncaller: Oh, is that so?\nreceiver: So you can see if you have to come up with a loan limit.\ncaller: Is it possible to borrow more than 3000?\nreceiver: If you're comfortable with credit, you can go over 3,000.\ncaller: Yes, we'd like to make loans only to banks that are financial institutions or accredited institutions, and we want to avoid these kinds of large mortgages.\nreceiver: It's possible in the financial world.\ncaller: If that's okay, what's the limit? What's the interest?\nreceiver: The interest rate ranges from 2% to 3% to 3%, from 80% to 90% to 50%, up to 400 million yuan.\ncaller: I can prove my income, and I'm paying a lot of money for health care, but what do I have to prove my income to get a loan?\ncaller: It depends on the limit, so if you submit both the business and the health plan, and you check your financials, can you confirm the limit? There's an expectation, but we've almost paid it all.\ncaller: I've got my name on your business license, and I'm in business now.\ncaller: And then I'm going to prepare the paperwork, like the business registration form, the application form, and the Global Compact Agreement, and I'll apply.\ncaller: Can we get the results back on the same day?\ncaller: You're welcome to do the autopsy with me.\ncaller: Do you think it's possible for a husband and wife to share the same name?\ncaller: It's a copy, is it?\ncaller: So the loan and the mortgage have to be identical, but can they be co-signed?\ncaller: Yes thank you.

It's a recording terminal, it's an investigative terminal. So you and I are going to record all of our conversations, and you can use this as evidence in court to prove that you were harmed, so you can't lie or cover up a case. Obstruction of justice is severely punished.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The recording shows that the case you're involved in right now is a fraud, and it's shocking, and it turns out that this Kim Hee-Hil member of the party is a bank employee, and we've got three or four people in custody, and the fraudster in this case is Kim Hee-Heil, a 38-year-old man from Kampong Chhnang, who was a former SCO employee. This is a big case that hasn't been disclosed to the outside world and is still under investigation, so I'm going to ask for some security, but I don't want to say anything, because there's obviously a suspect on the run, okay?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, the recording doesn't take very long, so before you record it, do you have any idea what kind of case I'm involved in right now, or that I'm taking a victim's position and being investigated?\nreceiver: I don't know what it is.\ncaller: So, I don't know Kim Hee-chul, I've been duped, I have never made a bank account with our bank, and I'm not asking you to say this.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: If you're a victim of identity theft, there's a situation where you have to prove or cooperate with the investigation.\nreceiver: Oh, this is... yeah.\ncaller: So I'm going to start with a brief introduction to my agent, and I'll go straight to the recording. The agent is the Seoul Central Bureau of Investigation's Financial Crimes Investigation and the 3rd Division's Investigator of Emerging Trends. Tell me your identity.\nreceiver: It's an even number.\ncaller: Yes, please confirm the date of birth of Mr. Han Dong-soo, born on June 5, 1985.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you know 38-year-old Kim Hee-chul?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: Yes. Around March 2017, a bank and our bank receipts were issued at one of the iron ore mines in the city of Kwon Min?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: Did you know that your lieutenant, Han Sung Soo, was exposed and used as a cannon fodder for the crime?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: First, the directors of our bank and One Bank in their own names were frozen without consulting their doctors to prevent them from being used for crime and causing additional victims.\nreceiver: Well, yeah.\ncaller: With all due respect, do you have any idea what that freezing procedure means?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: I'm here to tell you that, as a matter of policy, we've asked the Financial Conduct Authority to suspend the issuance of these securities.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you understand me?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you have a bank account that you're using normally, in order to avoid secondary damage, please state only the corresponding bank transaction.\nreceiver: The bank I'm using?\ncaller: Yes, yes, you have to tell me that you posted it, that you're legally posting it, and you're using it.\nreceiver: We, the one, the corporate, the Sahel.\ncaller: We're going to freeze all but one of the four securities that we've found, do you agree?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: In your case, you don't do things like our financials or our bonds or our stocks, do you?\nreceiver: No, not at all.\ncaller: I understand that you're going to get a statement from the bank, because if you were to be harmed later, it's very likely that your personal information was leaked from the bank. The fraudster in this case, Kim Heechul, was a former employee of the bank for about five years.\nreceiver: No, it's just that I'm on the phone right now.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: I can't confirm that the person you're calling is actually working for the Seoul Police Department.\ncaller: Oh, my God.\nreceiver: Do I have to tell you everything?\ncaller: Sir, I'm actually going to investigate, but you're suspicious, and I understand all this.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I understand that because we're an investigative agency, we don't ask you for your personal information, and we certainly don't demand anything from you. There's a drug-recording investigation, and you come out and you come to our precinct and you're interrogated, and it's all part of the same investigation, but there's one difference, and that's that we're investigating agencies, and we're going to investigate our finances based on your statement, to see if there's any use of your toll booths, and to see if you've opened a toll booth, and the verification process only takes about six hours.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So when you come to the coroner's office, you're in the interrogation room for 10 to 20 minutes, but you have to breathe for six hours until this investigation is over, so if you don't have a criminal record, you can help with the investigation as a medic, but if you have a felony record, or if you're a criminal, you just get a subpoena.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And he's got 300 to 400 victims, and he can't investigate all day.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This part, of course, is now being used to buy money and pay bills.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You know it's a felony to serve a warrant.\nreceiver: I mean...\ncaller: It's understandable that you're worried about this at first, it's natural to be suspicious, but now you have to investigate because you've been contacted.\nreceiver: Oh, that's right.\ncaller: Yeah, because it's up to you how you do it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And, of course, we're going to send you all the money that's involved.\nreceiver: Oh, that's right.\ncaller: We're not asking you to pay us or transfer your account, no, that's voice phishing.\nreceiver: Do you mind if I say yes?\ncaller: First of all, because everything is being recorded, the investigation is still ongoing, so I'm just going to check on the use of the account that you created.\nreceiver: It's an escrow account?\ncaller: Yeah, I mean, there's a total of two bank accounts in the Gulf, only two withdrawals.\nreceiver: Yeah, we're opening up a bank of our own for deposits.\ncaller: What about the bank?\nreceiver: One of them has a tender.\ncaller: Is that your bail bond?\nreceiver: Yeah, and there's one withdrawal period that I think you might have had a long time ago, and that's the one you're using right now.\ncaller: Yes, you have three companies, two checking accounts, and one leasing account, three in total?\nreceiver: Oh, I have a safe deposit box.\ncaller: Oh, so there's four of them right now.\nreceiver: One, the bank has a checking account.\ncaller: We're going to do the investigation in the afternoon, and our financial supervisor is going to open your accounts, and if there's even one checking account at the post office other than your statement, then after the reorganization, any checking account, any savings account, any minus account, anything like that, we'll consider it an illegal account.\nreceiver: There's a post office, there's a student loan account receipt, does that look like a receipt?\ncaller: Oh, you have a loan account?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Okay, so now that I've made my point, we have one bank loan account, two savings accounts, and we have four banks, one homeowners insurance policy, two deposits, and one post office, right?\nreceiver: There will be a corporate bank.\ncaller: Yeah, only four accounts you borrowed from?\nreceiver: Yeah, it's her fourth semester, and she's been on scholarships all four of them.\ncaller: You've had four loans and four accounts?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: OK, so this is the last one. You're being identified, and once you're in the Straits, how much do you normally have to be registered for today's entry fee? I mean, I'm talking about your current amount of protection, I am talking about the balance. This is something that you don't have to specify exactly, but if it's a few seventy thousand won, a few eighty thousand won I'll give you a million won article.\nreceiver: It's like two million.\ncaller: It's going to be $100,000 to $200,000, $500,000 to $600,000, something like this.\nreceiver: They're all under $100,000.\ncaller: I'll tell you what, the total cost of entry to the Straits is less than $100,000.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Once you have a difference of more than one million yuan in your account receipts, that account is considered illegal money and you're subject to a precautionary freeze. So you've deposited a total of less than 100,000 yuan in the Gulf, and if we find two or three million yuan in this way, the rest of the funds are all illegal money, and we confiscate them, you understand?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yeah, well, this is the last one.\nreceiver: It's less than $100,000.\ncaller: Yes. How much money should the post office have?\nreceiver: It's less than $100,000.\ncaller: What's the approximate total of two entries, two deductions, two bids, and two withdrawals from a corporate bank?\nreceiver: The entry fee is less than $100,000.\ncaller: Yeah, less than $100,000. Yeah, what about the savings account?\nreceiver: The savings account is... less than $500,000?\ncaller: Less than half a million dollars.\nreceiver: I've got less than half a million dollars in my checking account.\ncaller: What about one bank?\nreceiver: It's less than $100,000 for one bank.\ncaller: Okay, well, first of all, you don't have any other statements to back it up?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, the recording is over, the investigation is over, but if the findings differ from what you've said, you're guilty of perjury, and in that case, you'll have to go to your office and explain yourself, because when we're done with the investigation, we'll send you the results at your home, and you'll verify them, and then you'll get the victim's testimony.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, well, you've been working a lot today, and it's been rough, so you can get back to your routine.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Well, I saw an article about Christmas cakes here once, and there are a lot of pretty cakes in the Christmas season, but in hotels, even a cake with a high price of $70,000 or $100,000 is so popular that it's sold out, and well, I think these trends are good, because I think it's okay to have a high price if it gives you a sense of happiness or satisfaction, but I think there might be some controversy. What do you think?\nreceiver: I know, first of all, it's more important to be happy while you're alive, so, you know, on a special day, a special occasion, these products that give you this kind of psychological well-being, they look good, but they're probably too expensive, so, they're not all the same, they don't all have the same income.\ncaller: I don't think I've ever been a fan of Essence, and I've never bought anything and uploaded it, but now I see people putting expensive products on their own Essence, which I really appreciate, but I think there are some people who feel psychologically deprived, so every time I do that, I feel like I want to buy something like this, and I try to buy it, but it's a little expensive, and I think I'm hesitating, so the trend these days is DIY, and there's a term called two-it-your-self, and it's more expensive, and you go and make it yourself, and you feel like you're being rewarded at a lower price for making it.\nreceiver: I've never had a cake or cake or cake before, and I want to try it, and I've got it, and then I looked up the price, and I looked up that kind of topping, and it's a little bit more money, and then it looks like it's better to just buy it, because the price doesn't differ that much, so it doesn't make a lot of difference, but it's more important to have that kind of heartfelt gifting, or I just don't know how to look at it and taste it again.\ncaller: And I've seen people say that they're very interested in these characters these days, so it's nice to buy a cake like that in a hotel that's so expensive, but it's relatively inexpensive, so you can buy this ice cream cake and feel your happiness.\nreceiver: I like Snoopy as a character first of all, but there's no Snoopy in Baskin-Robbins yet, but then again, I like ice cream cake more than cake, so I've bought it a couple of times, and it's really important for the marketing, because it tastes like something I don't want to eat, so if you don't have a cute character or something like that, you'll have to buy it, even if the price goes up a little bit, so maybe if you make a cake like this with a character, it's going to cost a lot of money, but I think there'll be a lot of people who actually eat it.\ncaller: Well, I made a cake once when I was doing the center program, and it was Christmas season, and I was making a cake to make Santa's face, and the first time I saw a cake, I thought it was easy, but it was very difficult to draw a Santa beard with whipped cream, so it wasn't very pretty, and now that I think about it, I wanted to make that cake again, and I really wanted to make one of those cookies from Hansel and Gretel when I was a kid, and I made that fish cake, and I filled it up so tight, and now I'm thinking about designing a program like that, and I think that would be good for marketing, and I thought, oh, well, when I saw this character cake in this article, how do I feel?\nreceiver: First of all, I'd like to say that this is chocolate, because I like chocolate, and I think it's delicious, and, uh, the over-the-top action rabbit, that's not really my style.\ncaller: Well, if I were to make the cake myself, I'd be thinking a little bit cheaper, from $40,000 to $60,000, because I'm selling a lot of it for $20,000 right now.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I believe that the evidence shows that the average retail price for five trousers is 15,682 rubles, which is only 88 rubles less than 17,200 rubles at the same time a year ago.\ncaller: I think it's a big impact on the big business because we're doing direct trade in the big distribution market or Home Plus Imat or something like that, and we think that buying in bulk and delivering to the consumer has led to a decline in prices. Consumers are happy to buy cheap, but farmers want to sell at a lower price, and some big companies give it to the consumer for a good reason, but the farmers see so many losses and think that it is a disadvantage that they have to sell. To stop that, it would be good if the fishermen also built a separate distribution network and feed the distribution again.\nreceiver: Well, first of all, there's a lot of problems with the distribution structure, for example, in the livestock industry, the distribution structure is quite extensive, it's taken from the farmer who primarily raises it, slaughters it, packs it, and then ships it off to another place, where it's often sold in a general butcher shop, where you can get the meat in the market, and it's the same with turkeys. So to solve this kind of distribution structure, minimizing the turkey handling or the distribution process, or at least reducing the intermediary fees by one or two stages in the distribution process would be a win-win for both the consumer and the turkey producer, and I think it's a winning structure for the turkey producers. Do you think that the recession has such a big impact on turkey prices?\ncaller: I think the recession has an effect on the price of consumer goods, because people have to consume, and if the price of goods is cheaper than the price of services, then that's not a good thing.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I'm going to make sure that you don't suffer any further damage.

Wait a minute, are you sure that you've been convicted of fraud and violating the Electronic Transactions Act, which means that you're connected to an account tracking investigation for payment issues and so on? Are you in the right place?\ncaller: I don't know what I'm talking about. What are you talking about?\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: No, they said it was leaked from somewhere else, that it was used...\nreceiver: You don't even know what it is, and I'm going to explain it to you again, but first, I'm just going to say a few things, because you're either the prosecutor of the case, or you haven't verified the allegations against the victims, and you're saying that you don't have an accurate understanding of what the employee was told randomly about the case.\ncaller: No, you won't.\nreceiver: I think that's what you're talking about, but first, I'm going to give you a first-hand account of what happened and how it happened.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: And now you're going to go into an account tracking opener for yourself, and as part of the investigation process, we'll track and open your financial records to see if there's been any ill-gotten gains or illegal funds or if you've had any relationship with the victims, and therefore your entire financial records will be blocked on Friday.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: If there's any part of what I'm saying that you don't understand, just say so.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: In the short term, seven days, in the long term, it could take three months to complete the investigation, and it could take longer, depending on the prosecutor's judgment. If you agree, you can file a complaint with us through the courts, and only for the financial security necessary for your livelihood, the Depository Protection Act will proceed.

Well, I'm also inclined to buy one of these cakes if it's a party or if you have to enjoy it with your friends.\ncaller: I've never heard of the word \"gingerbread\" before, but in my case, I'm looking for a more affordable way to spend $70,000 on one of these cakes, $80,000 on this bar, and I think it's better to just have a chicken or four fries, or pizza, or chicken and pizza, or a variety of foods, and I'm thinking, well, if this is the kind of cake that tastes good, I'll buy it at 40,000, and if it's more than that, I think that's a waste of money.\nreceiver: Of course, I think that the most common bakery in our country, such as Parivaguette Touréjour, is going to be the most competitive and the best seller, and we've already talked about the Dia people, who consume these cakes made by themselves. I also said that the cake sheet itself only costs 7,000 yuan or 8,000 yuan, based on my own experience last year, when you make cakes like this, it doesn't cost a lot of money, so do you have any idea why people think you should pay more money to buy them?\ncaller: I think it's time for you to make your own, and you have to have an oven or something, and you need a lot of different ingredients, and it's expensive, but it's hard to make it yourself, and I think, for some reason, I wish people didn't make it themselves, because it's cheaper, it's fun, and there's rewards.\nreceiver: Yes, I've also had the opportunity to make a cake with my friends at a Christmas party last year and have a party and post a picture on Instagram. Now, in our younger generation, Instagram is a way to share your life, or have fun, or take a pretty picture, or have something to be proud of, because it's one of the ways to share all of this stuff, and I think it's crazy that Instagram now plays such an important role in all of life, and by posting a picture of a cake like this, I can show other people that I had a good time, or it can be a way to remind myself that I've had a great time, so I'm posting it, and I'm thinking other people are posting it, too.\ncaller: In my case, I don't think it's a bad thing that our country is now in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic, and I'm posting these lifestyle habits and stuff on Instagram and Instagram and stuff about my own lifestyle and stuff, because it seems like the game has slowed down because of the coronavirus, and that's the game, and I think that this is a situation where you can consume and live and consume and play better, and, uh, in the long run, I think that's a situation where self-employed people can be more empowered, so I think that these new consumption habits and life habits are not a bad thing, because from my point of view, cake is now using human characters to emerge into modern art through visual effects, into modern art, so it's not just about eating cake anymore, it's about decorating something like this, what do you think about this?\nreceiver: I think it's very good, in a way, to use multiple characters to promote, uh, from a marketing point of view -- Tourézur used Disney characters, and Seven Eleven was supposed to enhance the dolls when they were buying the soulless and the soulless cake -- but of course, uh, I think it would appeal to younger consumers, especially if you had a character like that, and you're not going to be able to sell your product because you've seen so many collabs, like Spawn, and all these other clothing stores, like Kakao Friends, and so on, so I think it is very good from a marketing perspective, but the hotel cake recently went from $80,000 to $100,000, and the Starbucks cake was over $7,000 more expensive than last year, so why do you think the prices keep going up and going up?\ncaller: I think it's a marketing term, I don't remember, but it's kind of an upscale strategy, because in the end, it's like we're buying goochie prada no matter how expensive it is, and this doesn't sell, so it's sort of an image-upscale strategy.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

classify: <conversation>\ncaller: There's a place I want to go.\nreceiver: I've just come from Daegu and I'd like to go to Qingdao, but have you seen any Qingdao?\ncaller: Yeah, I saw it a little while ago, and it was surprising because it was more rural than I thought it would be, and it had a lot of air, and it's called the Wine Tunnel, and it is very, very deep, and inside there were people selling wine, and the lights were very well decorated, so it was beautiful, and there was something called the Provence, which was like a festival of lights, it was very big, it was a nice place for a few families or couples to go and have fun, and take pictures, and it seemed even more beautiful when I went at night, and the light was brilliant.\nreceiver: Oh, I'm probably in Daegu right now, and I've been to the mountaintop, and I really like the view, so I went there and saw the view, and it's really beautiful because you can see all the sights of Daegu, and there are a lot of cafes there, and they're called rooftop cafes, and it looks beautiful from above.\ncaller: I've heard a lot about the Front Mountain, but I've never been there, so I thought I'd take the cable car.\nreceiver: Yeah, I took the cable car up, and now I have to walk down, and it's really hard.\ncaller: I can't afford to go abroad right now because of the coronavirus.\nreceiver: I wanted to go to Japan because of the coronavirus and all the issues in Japan, but before that, I wanted to say that now I'm a Yuhua and I want to go there and go to a place like the hot springs and do some healing trips.\ncaller: I wanted to go to Boracay, because it's where people go a lot now, and it's the perfect place for water sports, and the sea is so beautiful, and I saw the people on the yacht, and I've seen the boats, and it was just such a picture, and I thought going there would be so stress-free and so healing, and it would be so much fun.\nreceiver: In my country, I'm originally from Pohnpei, and next to it, the race is really close, so it's really fun to go to the race, see the skyline, go to the zoo, go there, take pictures and play, and in the race, there are so many streets that there is a restaurant called Zhuilidan Road, where you can eat, eat and go to a cafe, and have a good time.\ncaller: Yes, I think I was impressed by Busan, I'm originally from China, and I've never been to Busan, but I've traveled there once or twice, and I love the sea so much that the sea was beautiful, and its famous beach and its beach bridge were beautiful, especially Busan, which is now beautiful in summer, but in winter it's called the Christmas lights festival in the southern part of the city.\nreceiver: Well, I guess I'll have to go with my best friend and fight a little less, so it's kind of like a travel plan, because I like to plan things out rather than improvise, and I hope you're right about that with your friend, and now it's a taste, and now I hope it's right, because I think that kind of travel style is kind of important.\ncaller: Well, I'm going to the Emperor, because the trip is scheduled for a certain period of time, and I think there's something that wastes some time when I go spontaneously, so I'll go where to go, what to eat, and so on.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm a photographer, and I take a lot of pictures because I like my friends to look pretty, so I'm more of a camera person than a photographer.\ncaller: I'd also like to recommend the race, because I've probably been to the race a few times, and the yellow brick road is beautiful, but the famous hill there is now very crowded, and in the fall I went to the pink mulberry, it was so full of pink that it was so pink, so beautiful, and I borrowed a pair of shorts there, and I set a time and took a picture, and there were so many people, and something was good abroad, but also in the country, and I could see such a beautiful landscape, so when I traveled, there was a trip that I remembered most.\nreceiver: I went to the Philippines for a while, and it wasn't really a trip, it was a language course, but now I'm taking classes during the week, and I'm traveling on the weekends, and it's all sea now, so I've been doing a lot of snorkeling and sailing yachts and stuff like that, and I had a little bit of fun with that kind of foreign travel, and it was really fun.\ncaller: I've never been abroad, so there's a lot of places I'd like to go, but I'd also like to go to the Philippines, the Maldives, Hawaii, and New York, and I like the ocean a little bit, and the scenery is nice in New York, but I want to go to all of them, especially a little bit.\nreceiver: I don't have a license or a car, so it's really hard for me to walk around, and now I'm not physically strong enough to walk around or use public transportation all the time, which is kind of hard.\ncaller: I guess I don't have a car, so I'll either go with someone who has a little car, or I'll take a rental car, and once I have one car, it's too convenient, but without a car, now I have to figure out the real public transport all day long, and I'll go without a little car.\nreceiver: I told you I went to Qingdao, but did you eat anything while I was there?\ncaller: Well, I love food so much that I've looked it up on the Internet and on my phone, and when I got there, I was in a restaurant called Chinto Station, and there were a lot of reviews about it, and I went there, and it was famous not only for its gourmet steak, but also for its beef steak, and then I took a taxi, and the taxi driver said that it was just delicious, but it was just a little hot because of some reviews, so I went, and I waited in line for a long time, and I walked in, and I was surprised, because it wasn't that big, and it wasn's not clean, and it didn't taste so good, and now I think it was a little bigger, but now it's not so bad, because people are usually going to places like that, and it's very popular.\nreceiver: I like to travel alone, in case.\ncaller: No, I'm a loner, so I'm kind of lonely, and I don't like to be alone, and I've never thought about traveling alone, but I've seen a lot of people traveling alone in places like TiVo, so it seems like there's some advantages to being alone, and there's something about being alone that you don't have to fight with, so it's nice to go once in a while.\n</conversation>\nReminder:

A little while ago, our investigative team was investigating financial fraud in the city of Yizhou, and they seized a large number of credit cards and illegal distribution centers.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But one of them, the head of the Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development and the head of one of the banks joined us in the seizure.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, the cashiers have now checked all the bank accounts, and it has been confirmed that they were opened on January 5, 2015 in the name of Mr. Ikekwon.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Are you aware of the contents of the memo you opened?\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: So, on a Monday in January 2015, you opened two branches of the Bank of Agricultural Cooperation and One Bank?\nreceiver: No, it was last year.\ncaller: You didn't do it yourself.\nreceiver: I'm sure it was last year.\ncaller: Didn't I tell you this year that it was inaugurated on January 5th, 2015?\nreceiver: No, it wasn't opened on the 15th of January.\ncaller: So you're saying you didn't open it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, have you, in the last two or three years, lost anything that might have contained such personal information as a wallet or some form of identification, a passport?\nreceiver: Something was missing.\ncaller: You've lost something.\nreceiver: It's your wallet.\ncaller: You've been reassigned.\nreceiver: You did?\ncaller: You've been reassigned.\nreceiver: I did, and now I do.\ncaller: And the guy we just arrested is this former bank employee.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, you've been with the bank for three years, and you're being investigated by us for allegedly illegally using accounts that were kept in a human state by the bank, or information that was leaked. Have you ever been contacted by a financial institution about having your personal information leaked?\nreceiver: There wasn't.\ncaller: He didn't exist.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, in this case right now, not just you, but about 200 people across the country are involved, some of whom have illegally handed over these warrants in exchange for money, like a big gas station, and most of them are seeing this damage as their personal information is being leaked.\nreceiver: What are we gonna do?\ncaller: I'm going to ask you today if you've been paid for this case, whether you've sold warrants, whether your identity has been stolen.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The important thing is that the account in your name appears at the scene of the crime, and I need you to explain to me what's going on.\nreceiver: I don't know how to explain it.\ncaller: I'm going to ask you a few questions.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: In the case of the question, it was a recording of the whole thing, and this recording was submitted to the court when you opened the victim's credentials.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So I'm going to ask you to answer my question simply and honestly, but first, would you mind stepping forward with the recording and making a note?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Let me know when you're ready.\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: I'll call you back. This is Seoul Central Police, High-Tech Crime Team One.\nreceiver: It's high-tech.\ncaller: Crime team one.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: This is Investigation Team One.\nreceiver: Are you Kim Jae Woong?\ncaller: Did you finish your notes?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Okay, we're going to do this in recording mode, but you're just going to answer what you know, okay?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is that right, Mr. Ekong?\ncaller: Are you the one who doesn't know that electricity is a forty-two-year-old male transition period of insanity?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is it true that on January 5, 2015, you opened the offices of the Bank of Agricultural Cooperation and the Bank of Hansa at the Iron Mountain Square branch in Kampong Chhnang?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Are you there?\nreceiver: No, it was last year.\ncaller: Didn't you tell me that you opened on January 5, 2015?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Have you ever visited the City of Light in January or February?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: I'm not here. Are you currently staying in an indoor villa or are you staying in a company?\nreceiver: The company.\ncaller: Are you with the company?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First, the farmhouse that's been opened in your name, and the Hanbanks ammunition depot, since we just found this at the crime scene?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So how was it opened, and now we've got it frozen. Do you know what you mean by frozen?\nreceiver: You're not going to run out of money on that, are you?\ncaller: Yes, he's been suspended by the FCA.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And what you're doing now internally is you're going to do a cross-examination of what you know now at the FCA and what you know today, respectively.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You said earlier that you had no idea that these two had been opened.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: In addition to this, if you don't know that another bank has opened the same wallet that you didn't know about, I'll start by comparing it to the wallet you're currently using.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: What bank note are you dealing with?\nreceiver: It's our bank.\ncaller: Our bank?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then what?\nreceiver: We have banks, we have post offices.\ncaller: There's a post office. And there's more?\nreceiver: And there is none.\ncaller: You deal mainly with our bank and the Post Office Bank, is that it?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: These booths opened last year?\nreceiver: No, that was a long time ago.\ncaller: You keep insisting that you opened the window last year, but what window did you open last year?\nreceiver: It's from Shinhan Bank.\ncaller: Does Shinhan Bank do business now?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So you're going to have to tell me all the bills that you're dealing with right now.\nreceiver: Do you do it all? We do the National Bank, we do the Shinhan Bank, and we do it all. Hello? Hello?\ncaller: So the banknotes you're dealing with are now our bank, the Post Office Bank, and the Shinhan Bank, the People's Bank of China?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You don't have any other bank accounts, do you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Other than that, are you dealing with any other banks right now?\nreceiver: Where?\ncaller: Do you have any dealings with any banks other than the Bank of America, the Post Office, or the Citizens National Bank?\nreceiver: It doesn't exist.\ncaller: So if we find an account or a money order in your name in any bank except the four, we'll treat it as a criminal opening, and we'll freeze it.\nreceiver: Please excuse me.\ncaller: Do you personally transact and manage our bank, the Post Office Bank and the Shinhan Bank National Bank? How many accounts are opened by our bank in your name?\nreceiver: One of them.\ncaller: The post office.\nreceiver: One of them.\ncaller: What about Shinhan and the People's Bank?\nreceiver: All of it.\ncaller: Do you have a credit card or a debit card in your name?\ncaller: There isn't one.\ncaller: So, if you have a receipt like this, or if you find a receipt, and we're going to freeze it for you in the next hour, is it normal to have an approximate amount of money in your vault right now after you've made your last transaction?\nreceiver: How long does it take?\ncaller: It's our bank.\nreceiver: It's normal to have about four million left.\ncaller: What about the Post Office Bank?\nreceiver: The post office just won't take a commission for this.\ncaller: Very few or no post offices would be normal.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is it normal for the newly formed National Bank to have little or no liquidity?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Do you use your credit card separately for internet banking or mobile banking or telemarketing?\nreceiver: I wouldn't do that.\ncaller: You've never used one of those before, so you don't have to use a banknote to make a separate online transaction.\nreceiver: Yeah, there's been a lot of accidents lately.\ncaller: You go directly to the bank, and you deal only through the bank's window.\ncaller: You got it.\ncaller: Okay, so here's the note that you made earlier.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I'll write down the case number.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The case number is 2015.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Check with me to make sure you got your notes right on the 1005 hijackings.\nreceiver: 2015 survey 1005 cases of forced disappearances\ncaller: Yeah, you got that right.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Because I'm going to put you on an internal line with the designated prosecutor in charge of this case, and when you do, you're going to have to give me your case number, give me your name, and prove that you're an innocent victim in this case.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yeah, well, if you'll just hold on a second, I'll put you on the inside line right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: What happens to your identity?\nreceiver: It's this cycle.\ncaller: Yeah, yeah, and now that you've been handed a case number by the investigators, what's the case number?\nreceiver: Twenty-five years of research and development.\ncaller: It's the 1005 case.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Were you taking notes?\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: I'm working as a team leader in a high-profile crime investigation, and my name is Kim Sung-wook, and I'm your personal investigator, and you've been briefed by the investigator on the case, do you understand?\nreceiver: Yes, I can understand that.\ncaller: I'm going to listen to you and see how much you understand, and then I'll tell you about the case recommendations, but if you do, just tell me.\nreceiver: I mean, isn't that what you're talking about when you say that you used my name, and now the director of the agency has it seized by the investigating agency, so you're saying that he used my name to create the invoice?\ncaller: Do you understand that now?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm recommending this procedure to anyone because it's part of the legal process, and I'm legally obligated to speak to you, and I think you've got some understanding now, but what's important is that I'll give you some additional explanations. Recently, our Advanced Crime Investigation team searched an old-time criminal fraud ring. A large number of bullion boxes and a lot of credit cards were found at the scene, and among them were an Agricultural Bank and a bank teller with a pig in your name. The important thing is that if you didn't open this account yourself and take some kind of payment from the criminal gang members and illegally hand over the wallet, how would you investigate this part of the victim's victim when your identity is being stolen in some way? So you're correct in stating that you haven't overestimated the extent of your calculations.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, you have to listen carefully because this is the important part right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: There were two accounts in your name that contained illegal funds, and through those funds, there were victims, and the victims have now filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office, so we need to address that, and what you need to do today is get a victim's verdict and a victim support order.\nreceiver: What do you get?\ncaller: If the victim's verdict and certificate are not issued today, there will be four recommendations for action.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, briefly note what I'm about to tell you -- have you ever heard of the first prosecutorial subpoena?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You've seen it on dramas and on the news?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You have to come to us, you have to go through three hours in the morning, two hours in the afternoon, and then you're going to be questioned again, and then the first hearing will take place next Thursday at about 2 p.m., and you have to be present, but you can't be alone, and you have a private attorney, and you've got a private lawyer who's going to collect some data, and based on that data, there's a process where you have to prove that you're now a victim and clarify.\nreceiver: Where can I go?\ncaller: You have to appear in the Seoul Central District Court.\nreceiver: Where is it?\ncaller: It's in the Western Desert.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: Yeah, and what else do you want to know?\nreceiver: No, I think it's because this area is a reservoir.\ncaller: Do you want me to transfer this case to the district court?\nreceiver: That's where we do it.\ncaller: So if you're in the water, how can I turn the case over to him?\nreceiver: Do you want to go to the bathroom?\ncaller: Yes, we can. We can go to court.\nreceiver: Yes, that would be better.\ncaller: Now, the third indictment, there's still 40 million won left in the Straits Basin, which is literally 76 million won, and if you take away 40 million won, you're left with 36 million won. You have to have a legal explanation for that, and you can either contact the victims through your lawyers, or you can meet with them personally and get an indictment filed on our behalf. Right, right, right.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: Tell me about it.\nreceiver: Hi, how are you?\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Don't just use cash, check it every time you use a card, because if you want to get benefits, you have to check it every day in front of the store.\nreceiver: It's a bit of a hassle, but you can check it on the sharing card site and app.\ncaller: I'm trying to get a discount on my kid's hospital bills, but I'm spending more money at the department store.\nreceiver: I'm sorry for the inconvenience of not being able to provide the benefits conveniently.\ncaller: Yeah, I know, I haven't really looked into it, but I don't really have a clue, and I'm not going to say anything about it, but the other thing is, the department store is a place where you spend a lot of money, and if you're excluded from the usage fee, don't you have to write it in big letters or let me know in advance?\ncaller: If you're going to call it a benefit and put a condition on it, you have to make it clear that you're spending more money because you're filling a vacancy, but you want to make a suggestion.\nreceiver: Yes. I'll pass it on to the appropriate department.\ncaller: Oh, well, thank you.\nreceiver: Do you have any other questions?\ncaller: I'll just check one last time, so if you spend more than 30 bucks a month, all the other discounts apply, except for this department store and gasoline.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: Thank you. It was Kim Ji-jin, a card-sharing consultant.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.\nreceiver: Yes.

Do you know anything about this order?\nreceiver: No, not at all. I haven't forgotten at all, and there's nothing.\ncaller: On Thursday, April 9th, 2015, we checked the confiscated bank account against the bank's account. We checked that a new bank account has been opened at the Hong Kong Trade Center in Seoul, and a new one at the Sangsanchang Station in Sangsan. Have you ever received money from someone to open or hand over an account?\nreceiver: No, I'm not crazy, there's no such thing.\ncaller: Yes, the reason I'm checking this part again is that the accused in this case, Kim Jong-tae, is the operator of an illegal gambling site.\nreceiver: Yes, I don't even know who Kim Jong-il is.\ncaller: Do you know who Kim Jong-taek is? What he's been charged with is that he recruited distributors to transfer illegal gambling funds and money laundering, and in the process of recruiting, he's stated that he purchased wallets from an unspecified number of people across the country, including Mr. Hami-yong. That's why we're doing a linear investigation now, because it's said that the purchase was made for money, but now he's saying that there's no such thing at all.\nreceiver: Of course. Am I out of my mind?\ncaller: So anyway, now that we've found two warrants at the crime scene, it looks like my personal information has been leaked somewhere, either intentionally or unintentionally, and as you know, if the warrant is going to be opened, you have to show your ID card and go to the bank and have the warrant issued, and that's what it's going to be, right?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: How are you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, this is a state of emergency, and we're investigating, and it turns out that in the course of the investigation, bank employees, card company employees, telecommunications company employees, and now even loan company employees were involved in this case, so these people were manipulated by the telegraph, and they didn't know these things were happening, and the victims all over the country were completely unaware, and these people used these IDs and personal information to illegally trade with the Kim Jong Un Party and now with the Golden Bicycle.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yes, in some ways it's unfortunate that we now have the discovery of these two cards, but in the future, there could be other cards or cards that could be found, and more importantly, there could also be financial losses.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: That's why we're now in the process of investigating, and if you have any connection to Kim Jong Il, we'll inevitably be called in to investigate, but the identity of the accused, who really has no connection... hello?\nreceiver: I'm listening to you.\ncaller: If you're just a victim, I'm really a victim now.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: We'll take precautions to prevent any further damage.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, in the current system, that's exactly why you're not a confirmed perpetrator, a suspect, but you're being investigated as a reference, and if you're really a victim, you can get a reference drug test to prove that you're a victim.\ncaller: I did.\ncaller: What's the general process?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The whole investigation process is going on in the form of this recording, which will be used as evidence in the trial of Kim Jong-taek's rape case, which means that it can be adopted as evidence to prove that he is a victim, and it can be used as proof.

Anyway, people who are in the business of going can make it easy for them to give the rent, and they can also get it without any burden from the receiver.\ncaller: Well, my sister bought a commercial building on the other side of the street a few years ago, and then we couldn't afford to rent it, so we made the rent cheaper, and that's because of the Rental Car Protection Act, which states that you can only increase the rent by five cents a year for five years, and people are greedy, so at first you make it cheaper because you don't want to get out, and now it's five years later, and I think my sister wants to sell it for a lot more, but the law in our country, the Rental Vehicle Protection Act, says that you can raise the rent by only five cents per year.\nreceiver: I don't think it's a bad thing to do something like this with a tenant for five years, or five years later, or something like that. Well, there's a difference of opinion on how to say this, but if I'm talking about a personal view of the lender, of course, not five years, but a little bit shorter, because the market fluctuates accordingly, I'd like to do that, and in the case of renting, I may or may not be a carpenter again, so it's not five years but ten years, and you might want to apply the law that way, so I think this is a little bit vague, but I would like to think that it's just not the norm for five years.\ncaller: I don't think I'll ever be a landlord, but we'd like to be landlords, too, but it's not our building, it's someone else's building, and it's too much of a burden, and the royalties are too high these days, and if the landlord does well, he can ask us to leave, so this is quite a burden. Recently, in the news, the manager of the house in the western part of the village said that because the carpenter was good, the house owner asked him to leave, and he pulled a hammer and became a murderer.\nreceiver: Well, I don't know, but you can get a job as a craftsman without any burden on the part of people who have to be good craftsmen anyway, and if you don't, you'll have to do something like Corona now and lower your rent or do some archery or exercise, but I think you have to do that. I don' t know, if my life is easy, I can do that, but when my life is not easy, I think I won't be able to participate in such activities, but what I think is that we all want to live well with each other, so maybe we should consider each other' s characteristics a little bit and implement them a little bit.\ncaller: Yeah, they're not dealing with civil rights in Congress these days, and they're just fighting each other. They're getting their paychecks from the taxes we're paying them, and we're cutting the paychecks of all the members of Congress by 50 francs, and once you think you have to do that, if you think my store is going to increase the value of my store, it's going to be a good store, and it's only going to increase my store's value, if these tenants come into my store and work hard and make the street a good merchant, and if you do that, our building owners are going to get rid of all these people, and the rent is going to be expensive, and that's the biggest problem in our country, so that in the future our tenants won't be violating the right of survival and will be able to work well as clerks.\nreceiver: I think I'd like to be buried, but of course when I see this kind of thing, I think it's going to be a little bit difficult if it's not my building, and so on and so forth and so on, but I think there's no answer to this kind of rental relationship, I think people have to live with a little flexibility, but I want to, but I can't do it without my building, I think after seeing these articles or seeing the current market situation, I think that it's a little bit hard to be a builder, and I think that there will be a future where we can legally guarantee the rights of tenants like in developed countries.\ncaller: I think that's going to happen in the future if you say that only members of Congress are working hard, and they're not working right now, and I've been thinking about it a little bit, and I think that the Fair Housing and Rental Vehicle Protection Act currently prohibits raising the rent by more than five francs, but that's all there is to it, and right now it only protects renters for five years under the Rent-A-Car Protection Act, but I think we should keep that for about 10 years.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I think you've already checked the loan through intermediaries before checking with us. This has been received repeatedly by various financial agencies, and due to the accumulation of complaints, your credit rating has dropped too much.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So I'm going to briefly explain this to you, and I want you to understand that this is not a loan that I can go through on my own and give you a loan approval process, but it's an approval process through an outside contractor that pays a rebate to the financial settlement department.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: To put it simply, this is a loan where you contact a financial institution and you talk to the person in charge of paying off the loan, and I'm going to explain to you that this is a 100% viable loan, so instead of having your customers call you all over the place and leave their credit report with you, this is going to be an electronic loan where they're going to give you an arrangement with a financial institution.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So you're going to receive the money directly from your financial advisor, and once you've received it, you'll be able to go to your accountant and get your loan deposited, and then we'll take care of that.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We're going to help you with credit management for two months, so at the end of that two-month period, you've got all three of these banks that you've borrowed from, Redcorp and OK Savings Bank.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: All three of them had very high interest rates, and the rest of them were sun loans or something like that, and because of the high interest rates on all three of these loans, I'm going to repay all four of them in two months from our Lotte Capital with a 9% compound interest on the debt consolidation, but instead of me being able to repay the repayment loans to anyone in two months with savings, you can't create a continuity record at all during these two months of credit management, and you shouldn't leave a search record when you look for loans elsewhere.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So if you do these two things correctly for two months, we're going to be able to give you a nine percent repayment loan at Lottery Capital in two months. First of all, if you've listened to what I've just explained about loans that you're taking out as living expenses, you'll understand that this isn't a loan that goes the normal way.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And the reason I'm explaining this to you is because in your situation, you're not in a situation where you can just turn over the paperwork and get a loan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: It's an automatic loan, and you're not paying for it yourself, so there's a cost involved in the process, but the cost involved doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to tell the customer to pay for it first, because you'll have to get approval from a financial institution selected by the electricity company to accept the loan deposit first, and then you'll be able to verify that you've made the deposit and then you can pay it back to your electricity company, and in this case, you'll still be charged a much lower amount than others.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you're in the process of applying for a loan, you've been charged 33% of the loan amount, and if you're a thirty-three-pro, you can think of it as a one-million-ounce thirty-five-thousand-dollar transaction cost, and this is a 100% viable loan, so if you say that I've explained it to you and you're willing to go through with it, I'll help you get in there today and make it a success. If you say that you don't have a doctor, then I'll safely cancel the paperwork.\nreceiver: It's worth $1.3 million.\ncaller: What's that?\nreceiver: That's $1.3 million worth of electricity.\ncaller: Okay, so this is a loan that you're not going to be able to borrow on your own, so it's going to cost you something.\nreceiver: It costs $1,340,000.\ncaller: You can't think like that, because if it's two months old and you give it a replacement loan at 9% interest, the monthly interest is wrong. This time, in the case of mortgages, the annuity is thousands of dollars. This is a one-time entry.\nreceiver: Your belly is bigger than your stomach.\ncaller: The low cost is not that you're wrong, it's not the low cost, but it's definitely a loan that you can get out of 100 percent, and that's what I've explained.\nreceiver: And the mortgage is going to be 100 percent.\ncaller: The mortgage, it might not come out later, and then it's really going to pay interest later and then the principal will be due later.\nreceiver: If you count the mortgage, it's $100,000.\ncaller: That's subtracting, and then you just subtract the line, and then later you just substract the whole number, and you know you can do that, but didn't you notice something about the whole number?\nYou know, you take the line and the 10%, and then you pay the interest over and over again, once a day, and then you figure it out, and it's not a joke.\nreceiver: That's 1.2 million won a month.\ncaller: So instead of 100 times 10,000, 10,000 is now a line and a bunch, and so on and so forth.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

I'm just going to ask you to send me the three million won for the settlement, and then the three hundred thousand won, and I'll just take the one or the eighty million won.

Yes, it's the sales planning department. You're the customer, not the bank's headquarters, but the sales planning division.\nreceiver: Whether you've paid or not, I've already paid, so you can call me directly from there.\ncaller: Where are we going?\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Let me tell you, Mr. Barrow, you've been paid back three million dollars in barcodes, and I have the paperwork.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: If you'd like to call, you can do so now at Barocredit.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: The first thing you're going to hear is that your barcredit has not been repaid, because I've got the paperwork, and if you say that you're a customer with a negative balance, I'm going to help you with the cancellation, because I don't want to be in this mood of giving you a negative balance -- you know what I mean.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: And if you cancel the minus order now, three months from now, you're going to get a three million dollar refund on your credit card.\nreceiver: In three months?\ncaller: I just want you to know that if you had trusted me in the first place, if you had listened to me first, no matter how much you doubted or what you were doing, I wouldn't be so angry with you. But you, Kim Min-jin, have doubts. How can I issue a negative bond? I would have issued a negative bond.\nreceiver: Did I insult you?\ncaller: Did you insult your client, me, the lunatic, the swindler?\nreceiver: And then I called again, and there was no answer.\ncaller: You know, I don't know who you've switched, but the fact that they don't reveal their names is a fraud.\nreceiver: And then what?\ncaller: I've revealed my name, and if a police officer comes to me with an interrogator, he has to tell me his name, and I go to him.\nreceiver: You can call the police department, right?\ncaller: Is that right?\nreceiver: The lecturer's office.\ncaller: I know you're not an investigator, but if you are, can you tell me your name so I can ask you if I'm a real police officer?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Of course you don't, because you're not a cop, right?\nreceiver: And so I thought, well, he's...\ncaller: Even though he didn't tell me that he was a badass, a freshman, I gave him a discount today, even though I was in a bad mood.\nreceiver: I didn't mean to be rude, but I'm getting a call.\ncaller: Tell him to apologize to me, and I'll give you a negative bond issue tomorrow, and tell that guy to call me right now and apologize, and say he's sorry it's the beginning of a dog year.\nreceiver: He's a police officer.\ncaller: I'm going to take a negative tomorrow, okay?\nreceiver: He's a police officer, and he's there for a consultation, because of a phone number check.\ncaller: Well, then go to the police station, tell him to apologize to me, and then I'll give you a negative check tomorrow, because today's business hours are over, and I'll put it in for you tomorrow, or you'll get your money back in three months.\nreceiver: What do you mean, you get paid in three months?\ncaller: You'll be able to pay back the $300,000 you borrowed three months later.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yes or go to the guy, he's a police officer, go to the police station and go to the intelligence team and tell him to give me a call. When you get to the police department, will you call me? And then the guy will apologize to me for calling me a freshman and saying I'm crazy or I'm an asshole. If I say this one word, I'll give you a minus issue tomorrow. I'll take care of it and give you your minus container tomorrow. Tell him to apologise to me.\nreceiver: Where is it?\ncaller: I don't think I have anything to say to you anymore, and it's not like we're talking about the umbilical cord or anything, but we keep saying the same thing.\nreceiver: No, I said I'd show you a receipt, but why don't you show me?\ncaller: Why didn't I show you?\nreceiver: It wasn't a receipt, but no.\ncaller: I don't need a receipt. It's a receipt for the completion of the transaction, customer. I'll read it to you now. Let's see, yes, the confirmation of the repayment of the interest on the car is written by Kim Mi-jin's statement.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: I was going to talk to the customer, and I was not going to send him a receipt, but I was definitely going to give him a return document, even though I might see it later, but what did the customer do to me, the guy? The rookie, the dog, the guy, but I'm hearing this kind of abuse, and I'm going to send you this notice. The customer, the customer, change your mind, the customer couldn't call, the customer didn't send it, so go to the guy, tell him to apologize, and I will send you the return document and I will give you the receipt for the minus, and I don't care if you believe me or not, but anyway, for practical reasons, I am going to give the customer the minus container, and I made this confidential request, and I promise that I will keep my promise, or I will cancel it, or I won't.\nreceiver: Please correct the cancellation.\ncaller: You get it in three months, on your credit card.\nreceiver: Three million won?\ncaller: Right now, yeah, we're all very busy because of the work I'm doing.\nreceiver: You're getting it in three months?\ncaller: Yes, in three months.\nreceiver: Anyway, I'm the one who's paying for it. Do you think you'll get another loan?\ncaller: No, it's not a repayment, but you asked for a refund on your Barocredit, and you asked for it, and you got three million back.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: You're going to get your money back in three months, and if you cancel the minus order right now, but if you don't cancel it, you'll get a call from your customer saying that you've been reimbursed $3 million in your bar credit, and your minus is gone.\nreceiver: I'm sure you'll get a call from the director by tomorrow.\ncaller: No, I've got the paperwork, so I'm going to contact Barocredit.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Customer: I want to cancel, but you're going through a process with me that's legal, legal right now, and then it's going to take three months for the recovery team to process the cancellation. I told you what the recovery team is like. Ordinary VIP customers don't cancel, customer. But if you do cancel, it's gonna take three months because of the overdraft.\nreceiver: Until yesterday, when I got a call from the office, I didn't get this far.\ncaller: I know.\nreceiver: I don't get any calls from the front lines, and I can't get those calls back, so...\ncaller: You're not answering your phone?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I'll tell you one thing, the collection team is not here to advise you when you get this call.\nreceiver: No, and then I was going to ask you about the phone call that you didn't take, but we talked about it again, and you got another call, and you went to eat, and then you told me that it took you an hour to get here because you were wrong.\ncaller: I know.\nreceiver: I'm confused. I honestly think my name is someone else's name.\ncaller: Yes, the client. Now, whether the client was confused or not confused, the client wanted to trust me and go through with it, so I trusted the client, and I posted it like this, but the client didn't trust me first and only trusted the other person, and now we're going through with it again, and this is what happened.\nreceiver: I'm going to go ahead and do that.\ncaller: You've been saying the same thing for the last 12 minutes and 10 seconds anyway. Just tell me the bottom line. Can I cancel this minus order? Just? Do you want to be reimbursed in three months? Or do you want to get out of the minus order? Customer, I no longer deposit money with your customer. I don't do this. What do you do?\nreceiver: So three months, if you send a receipt there, when does the minus container come out?\ncaller: I'm leaving first thing in the morning.\nreceiver: I want him out by tomorrow morning.\ncaller: Yeah, well, I'll let you out first thing in the morning.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Tell him not to call me right now. Tell him to call me.\nreceiver: He's a real cop, he's a cop, and I don't have his number.\ncaller: If you see a policeman, go to your police station, tell me to apologize, I'll be in charge by tomorrow morning and give you the minus sign.\nreceiver: When I called to check the phone number, they said it was not a bank number, so I went to the police station and answered.\ncaller: I don't need anything. Just go to the guy, call him, give me a shout. I'll call him. Oh, Mr. Ishtar Young, I did something wrong in junior year, dog year, I just said this, I'll give you the minus box right away. And go to the police station and say something else to me.\nreceiver: You don't know if he's staying or not, do you?\ncaller: And then, until he apologizes to me anyway, I'm not going to be able to help you move forward.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Yeah, there's this one exceptional case that I have twice a year, twice, and I wrote to a client once, which I didn't even write to my parents because I heard about your client, and the real client came in, and he was using real high interest loans too much, and this one time, the savings bank wasn't making any money, and I was trying really hard to get it out, but the real client actually went to the police for the first time and was caught cheating, and this is a fraudulent scheme.\nreceiver: I called the police.\ncaller: I know.\nreceiver: I just called yesterday.\ncaller: I know.\nreceiver: I kept getting calls to make sure it was the right one, and I told her to make the call, and she just started yelling at me.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: And then there's this and this and this, and don't send it to us, and yeah, I just did that because I didn't get hurt here, and I did that, and I left, and before I left, I made that call, and I asked him to call this number again, and I said, is that the right number, and I called again, and he didn't answer, 1588 is the number that comes to me.\ncaller: Yes, please.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I owe my client an apology for what happened.\nThat's when he called, and that's how we reimbursed him.\nreceiver: He said I called the police station and asked who he was.\ncaller: Are you going?\nreceiver: I'm going to call the guy who was in charge of it, and I'm just going to tell him, yeah, I've been using it for a couple of hours now, and he's going to have to call me.\ncaller: Go to the police station, call me, he'll apologize, and I'll put you on that minus tomorrow.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Yes, call me when you get to the police station.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Right.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

It's nice to see the beautiful natural scenery, so where have you been recently?\ncaller: I went to Spain and Portugal in May last year, and I've been in Spain longer than Portugal, but I wanted to go to Spain because I had just studied a little bit of Spanish, and I thought it would be nice to be able to communicate a little bit, and there's something in Portugal that's a little bit like Spain, but a little bit different, and so I'm excited about it, and next time I want to go on a European trip that's going to be a little bit longer, so I can see a lot of countries.\nreceiver: I've never been to Europe, but I'm from New Zealand, so I went to New Zealand, and I really wanted to go on a pilgrimage to Spain with you, but then the coronavirus broke out, and I couldn't make it, so I got depressed, and I said, \"Where do you want to go before you die?\"\ncaller: Before I die, before I die, I want to go a little bit everywhere, a little bit I wish I hadn't been anywhere, but it's a little bit impossible, but once you've done it with someone, you have to go on a trip to South America, and you have to make a pilgrimage, and then the pilgrimage is going for a little bit of food, and the pilgrimages are a little bit fun, and it's so hard to eat, and then you want to go somewhere else, like to go to South America and go to the Bolivian lakoni desert and go to Cuba and go to Mexico and go eat good food.\nreceiver: I want to go to South America and see all the places that are so famous, like the Milky Way desert, and Mexico, and Mexico is so good, it's so delicious, and I want to eat it, and Cuba, where you've been, is so beautiful, and you've left all my gifts there, and I just want to go back and find them and bring them home to you, because I think if you go to Cuba, you'll still have those gifts.\ncaller: I was just leaving a little gift for you guys in Cuba, and I was gonna come back with you, and, uh, if we go to Cuba, you know, we don't have cell phones, so we can get a little bit closer, and if you go to Cuba it's so cheap, so we're gonna save money, of course, but I think we'll be able to save on travel expenses.\nreceiver: I don't know if I'm going to stay in South America for a couple of months, but like you said at the time, six months is a really long time, and it's not like we're going to be here tomorrow, it's like we've been here all day, and I want to experience a little bit of the atmosphere in each region, and the culture, and all that, and just live in the country, and of course when we're thirty years old, we want to go to the year when we'll be thirty, and you don't have any idea about South America or India or America.\ncaller: I'd like to go to India, you know, where you said that you speak eight languages, so that would be fun, too, and a little bit, um, I like that kind of atmosphere, a little bit of that, seeing people living with different religious cultures, and I think my Indian friends have a little bit more, but it's scary, I think you can try it out, um, you've been to India, I haven't had a sister who's been to India.\nreceiver: Yeah, she's in India too. At first, she even went alone. Yeah, I was worried about her a lot, but then she went to India, and I felt like I really liked her, and she's so pretty, and she has such a kind heart, and I really wanted to see her once, and I even liked her so much that I went twice, both times alone, but she's just so good, and I actually want to go again, so I really want to go once before I die, but I'm lonely, but it scares me a little bit.\ncaller: I'm from Canada, but I've only been in Canada for a little while, so I'd like to take some souvenirs with me when I go back, but it was so cold when you and I traveled to the east, and we didn't do anything because of the cold, so I can't do that. I'd love to go back when it's a little bit cooler, and I've eaten in Canada in the summer, and I want to eat again, and I would love to do a little bit of that, and if I do, I think it would be fun to have a tour guide with you, because you've been to New Zealand, where you've lived, and if you're ever in New Zealand, I've got a tour to recommend.\nreceiver: If you go to New Zealand, of course you have to go to South America and South America and the South Island, and the real reason I go to South New Zealand is because I'm going to see the South Island and that's why I say that the South Island is basically the reason I have to go, and if I go with you again, I want to go to the Bay of Ireland again, and I wanted to go with you, and we went to Thailand together, and it was really nice, and we were on that island together, and so I had a great feeling, because there are a few tourists, but there are very few Asians in Asia, and it's very confined and quiet, and I loved that feeling, and that place on the North Island of New Zealand called Bay O'Brien Island, it was really, really cool, and it felt like Copenhagen in New Zealand, so when I went to that Bay of Islands, I really thought about Copenhagen, and I thought it would be really, really fun if you and I went to New Zealand together, and I really wanted to go there, and you're one of the best places I remember going to New Zealand.\ncaller: Well, I think the most memorable thing is that Kofang Kofangan, when we traveled to Thailand, it took us a long time to get from Bangkok to Kofangan on the national railway, and then on the boat, and it took us almost half an hour, I think it took about a day or so, and then we got to the very corner of the island, and it really made us feel like we were alone, and it made us a little bit blind, but it's Thailand, and it's a little bit far away, and there's no public transportation, and we were staying in the same place in the woods, and we just called the taxi guy, and we called the guy next door, and we wanted to get out of town, and we rented a motorcycle, and we couldn't ride a bike, and we didn't even learn how to ride a bike.\nreceiver: I don't know much about domestic travel, because I've always thought that I've traveled more abroad than in my country, but the real travel is going with you tomorrow, playing with you in Seoul, and then going to Busan for a physical examination, so that's it. So a little bit of the coronavirus broke out, and for the time being, foreign travel, of course, can't be domestic travel, but I can't travel abroad, but I still think that if I'm a little quieter, I would like to travel domestically, so I wanted to go a lot, and now I'm studying Korean history, I want to go to the race too much, let's go when I'm quieter later. You haven't had a little risk or a little difficulty while traveling so far\ncaller: That's right, when we went to Malaysia last year, where did he fall? Yeah, he scratched his arm and broke his phone. It was a bit of a surprise. It was the first time he fell from such a high place like this.\nreceiver: I think it's dangerous because we rented a motorcycle in Copenhagen, but I only really learned to ride it once a few years ago, and I told my dad that I could actually ride it. We rented it, and even you didn't know how to ride a bike, and you rode behind me. That's what I was really scared of at the time, and I'm really sorry for not having a real traveler's insurance.\ncaller: Well, I've been traveling around the country for a while now, and I've heard that the food in the province is good, and I was with the governor and the governor on my last birthday, and I went to the province for a day or two, and I came here, but the food is too stimulating, and it's my style, and I like to cook and eat, so I thought I'd go a little longer, and there's something about the atmosphere, of course, it's all the same in the country, but the atmosphere varies somewhat from place to place.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I think they're working hard to relieve social stress from the characteristics of the Internet, but I think there's a little bit of a difference between adolescent spoilers and adult spoilers, and I think the most prominent thing about adolescents is that they're secondary symptoms, but the sudden release of hormones and physical growth is accompanied by personality changes, so they experience emotional changes more often than adults, and they're more competitive and more susceptible to stimuli like violence, whereas adults seem to have a greater desire to relieve stress from their social status and relationships in the form of defending others.\nreceiver: I think the most memorable issue in the entertainment industry was that of director Hong Sang-soo and actress Kim Min-hee. I think their issue was the biggest because they usually love love and war, but there was a lot of love and war.\ncaller: I watch a lot of dramas, I watched a very successful drama in 2016 called Aftermath of the Sun, and then I saw an article about a couple who were dating and getting married, Song Song and Song Hee, and I was encouraged to get married by the drama, but when I heard the news that they were divorcing after one year and eight months of marriage, I was very sad, so I think it was a memorable issue.\nreceiver: I'm usually at home a lot, and I'm always at home, and I watch YouTube, and I see all this stuff, and I think you're watching a lot of YouTube broadcasts where celebrities are broadcasting, like Han Ye-Sung or New Age, or Mamamoo Sola, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or Baby Yoda, or Blur, and so many other people, and I thought it was great to be able to see the new faces of these people, these actors and idols, and there's no difference between them and the general public, and it's just that I think it's been really nice to see all of these idols and actors from everyday life, from behind the scenes and from behind the camera, so it's very colorful and different. What do you think about the YouTube activities of the giants of celebrity?

Now the economy of the Republic of Korea is dominated by the people, not really big companies.

I don't think I've ever been awake during the day in the winter holidays, but when I was in high school, I was really frustrated because I had to take extra classes during the winter break, and the holidays are the longest winter, and there's a holiday called Christmas, and I think winter is the best season.\nreceiver: I think I travel a lot in the summer and fall, and I usually like to go to the ocean, because the ocean is too cold to go to in the winter, and there's just too many beautiful places around the house to go in the spring, so you go to the sea in the summer or fall, and you listen to the waves, and you play in the water.\ncaller: When I was a kid, I used to go skiing in the winter, and I remember one of my skiing buddies got into a snow fight, and his forearm was torn off, and he was taken to the emergency room, and I've had sex with him ever since, but still, the best season for me is winter, so I do a lot of activity in the winter. There's a playground near my house, on a slope, and in the winter when it freezes, I sit there, and I come down, and I did it in high school, and there are elementary school kids next to me, and it's kind of embarrassing, but anyway, it's fun, and we do it every year, and I was in elementary school, and I used to stand up in the winter and I'd slide on it, and I thought, well, you know, winter has a lot of memories, and you know, some seasons are the best times to study.\nreceiver: I think autumn and winter are good times to study, because in spring and summer, when the weather is so nice, you want to go outside and play with your friends, but in autumn and in winter, when almost everyone is at home, it helps you focus on your studies, because there's a lot of hurricane damage in autumn, and have you ever been hit by a hurricane?\ncaller: No, and when the storm comes, the wind blows really hard, and the windows are shaking, and I really like that atmosphere, so I don't really know if I've been damaged by the storm or not, but I know you hate cycling, so what do you usually eat when you go out to sea in the summer or fall?\nreceiver: Usually when we go to the seaside, we go with our families, and they love seafood, so they go for seafood, but I'm having them make meals at the seafood house, but the seafood is expensive, so I'm going to a lot of places that sell seafood, mainly seafood.\ncaller: Yes, there are many, and I've only traveled to hot countries like the Philippines so far, and it was really frustrating, because even Jersey is a hot place, but I was able to have fun there in the winter, and if I'm going to travel in the future, I want to go to the cold polar regions, because if I go to the Philippines, it's hot, and I can't sleep well, and I don't like the food and the culture of the hot places, and I think that if I travel to the warm places, I won't really enjoy it, but if I went to the cold places, I'm sure that the food, the weather, the clothes are all to my taste, so I'll definitely go to cold places.\nreceiver: So this spring, I went to the fountain in Chuncheon, and I saw the cherry blossoms, and I loved the sunshine, and the lake, and I wanted to go on a picnic afterwards, and you said that you hated summer, but did you have any bad memories of summer?\ncaller: It was a summer night, and I was studying in middle school, and it was so hot that I left the door open for a while, and a bug came in, and it flew in, and I could have caught it, and it came in and I was lying on the floor in my room, and I didn't even know it, and I got out of my chair and I stepped on the bug, and I couldn't sleep that day, and I wasn't studying, and I slept through the night.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How are you?\nreceiver: How are you?\ncaller: The person you contacted is Detective Kim Cheol-min of Seoul Central Police.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm calling to confirm that you've just completed a personal data breach.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: There's a little noise, but I've been talking out loud, and you can't hear me.\nreceiver: Hi. How are you?\ncaller: Yes, hello, I'm told that we've been contacted for some background checks regarding your current identity.\nreceiver: Yeah, I can hear you now.\ncaller: Yes, are you the 41-year-old from Guangzhou who's known as Kim Yong-sik?\nreceiver: He's a total stranger to me.\ncaller: This is the first time I've heard of this. The prosecutor's office is currently investigating a financial crime ring led by Kim Yong-sik Field. During the seizure of a distribution credit card and a large container at the site of this building, a personally identifiable ability and a cash register were found.\nreceiver: No, I had no idea what was going on with my privacy.\ncaller: When I did my first investigation, on January 27, 2016, at the Iron Ore Mine branch in Chongqing, it was confirmed that a canal had been opened to the Straits in his name.\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Well, first of all, the exact reason our prosecutor contacted you is to find out whether you are now a perpetrator who has sold warrants to Kim Jong-un's opponents for financial gain, or whether you are a victim who has been helped by a leak of personal information.\nreceiver: I had no idea.\ncaller: Yes, you understand what I'm saying.\nreceiver: I understand that, but I'm not really the first person to have my personal information leaked.\ncaller: First of all, that's something that needs to be investigated, because it hasn't been established yet, so I told you that I'm calling to find out if you've done any direct sales or if you have seen any damage.\nreceiver: Well, I've seen the damage.\ncaller: Well, first of all, because the account was used illegally, let's briefly talk about the duration of the incident. If you look at the Naver site, it's called the old country site. On that old country site, Kim Jong-il's party members only withdrew funds after intentionally depositing money using the account to sell effective goods for a cheaper price, and the money is dormant. So there are victims who did not receive the goods, and our victims are currently in the process of taking action against you.\ncaller: Credit cards, passports, cell phones -- these are some of the things we've seen or heard about.\nreceiver: I had been on the Internet before, and I didn't know it at the time, but when the jail was opened, I had used up all my personal information. I had used all my personal data, and there was this card from the NAACP, and as soon as it said, \"Enter your security card\", I knew it was a scam, and I knew what I was doing. By then, I had probably written down my social security number, and it was probably a NAACP account number and password, and I had given it to them. The security card was gone, so after that, after that, I called NAACP and I ended it all, I stopped all the deals with NAACP. And then I remembered that my NAACP ID was gone, because I had logged in from nowhere and changed my password a few times.\ncaller: Well, if you rectify what you've said, there's been a security breach in the CAP card, and there was a login attempt that I didn't try, and there's also been a data breach.\nreceiver: Yeah, I did, and that was probably last year, so I said, \"Yeah, well, I didn't have any positive damage, so it's not personal information\".\ncaller: You didn't give a shit.\nreceiver: I don't think I have a positive side effect.\ncaller: You don't want to see any financial damage.\nreceiver: So, yeah, I filed a complaint. I made a few calls, and I went through this process, and I got a complaint, and I was told what to do, and I took it in, because I didn't get any calls after I left here, and that's how it went.\ncaller: Now, I've filed a complaint, and now I'm going to record it for further investigation, and the reason I'm recording it is because of the Kim Jong-il trial next Wednesday, so I'm not going to apply directly to the judge, but I'm just going to create evidence to protect the victim's interests.\nreceiver: And then I'm just the victim.\ncaller: No, first of all, the investigation will have to produce a witness who can help us get back to Singapore.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, if you agree that I'm creating evidence, it'll help us catch him.\ncaller: Kim Nam-won said that the trial is next week, and there are other crimes that have not been solved yet, and in order to catch them, you are now involved with more than 180 people, apart from the citizens of the case.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So, in the first place, I'm calling you on a forensic basis to get an indictment, and if you're claiming to be an innocent victim, it's important that I make you kind through the recording, which is why I'm making the recording.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Okay, so I'm going to change the recording, and I'm just going to warn you that when the recording is made, it's a third-party breach, and if it causes a laundry alarm, you can't use it as evidence in court, and as I've said before, the rent is neither the victim nor the perpetrator, so to put it simply, this is a Chinese investigative credential, which is why you don't have the authority to disclose this case to a third party.\nreceiver: I'm in front of that school right now.\ncaller: You're a student. You're the principal. What are you, still a student?\nreceiver: Yeah, that graduate student.\ncaller: What college do you go to?\nreceiver: Yes, I go to a community college.\ncaller: Uh, can I borrow your pen and notebook now?\nreceiver: I don't have anything right now.\ncaller: Use a notepad on your cell phone. Uh, you'll have to write down who I'm with and the bank.\nreceiver: Hold on, I'll take that notebook and a pen.\ncaller: Now, I think you're talking to a third party, and I'm going to ask you to make a temporary effort in a space that doesn't involve the promotion of third parties or any other income.\nreceiver: It moved.\ncaller: Uh, what's the location of this call right now?\nreceiver: Outside the academy.\ncaller: You're on your own out of the academy. Make your notes.\nreceiver: I'll make a note of that.\ncaller: It's the Seoul Central Highway.\nreceiver: You're the one with the sword.\ncaller: We've got four high-profile crimes.\nreceiver: Some of the advanced crime investigations\ncaller: It's not a mountain, it's a fabric. It's state of the art.\nreceiver: What?\ncaller: I'm a criminal investigator, Detective Kim Cheol-min, and I'd like you to speak slowly, in a low voice.\nreceiver: This is Detective Kim Chil-min of the Seoul Central Police Department's Advanced Criminal Investigation Division One.\ncaller: And I'm going to ask you to go ahead and make a recording, and I'll do a recording of you, and I will say, \"I agree with you\", and you can say, \"Well, I'll make the recording right now\".\nreceiver: Yes, I agree.\ncaller: The place where you've lived for years, the city where you live.\nreceiver: I'm living in a dorm now.\ncaller: Check in at the hostel.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Please tell me where you live, what city you live in, where you are currently living and studying in a boarding school. Yes, yes, I understand. Do you know Mr. Kim Yong-sik, a 40-year-old man from Guangzhou, China?\nreceiver: No, I don't know.\ncaller: Is it possible to improve the air quality of the Basin and the South China Sea through the underground of the Iron Ore Mine in Phnom Penh? Yes, this account was found in an illegal site, so it was immediately frozen and transferred to the National Bank. Do you have any objections to this?\nreceiver: No, there isn't.\ncaller: Well, at this time, our office is conducting a joint investigation with the financial controller, so I'm going to tell you again that if we're going to take your statements and your depositor at face value, we're looking at it as a victim company, and it's going to be very unfair.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: So now you're in the Sahel, and one of you is in the financial sector?\nreceiver: No, no, my father.\ncaller: You're not using it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Just give me the name of the financial institution that you're using, except for the Bank of China and the Bank of Japan, so I guess you could use this financial example to say two financial institutions or a broker.\nreceiver: Yes, I'm only using our bank.\ncaller: Don't use our banks or cacao banks or securities or anything.\nreceiver: There's no other way.\ncaller: You're only using $10,000 in our bank, and you're going to have a withdrawal from your account by the Financial Supervisory Authority based on a false statement, and if the investigation is different, it may be deemed by the administrator to be a paid withdrawal, so don't object to this part.\nreceiver: Yes, it was.\ncaller: If you could just tell me one by one what you're using your bonds for, for example, why you're only dealing with one of our banks, one of our bank's depository accounts, one of the depository contracts, CMA securities, it would probably be something like this.\nreceiver: But I just remembered that there's a clearing house on the side of Shinhan Bank, not a corporate bank.\ncaller: There's only one.\nreceiver: Yes, there's a bill of lading in the new bank, and there's an open bill of exchange in our bank.\ncaller: You've got one for each of us, and you're saying that the order is an entry fee and a binding contract, because all the accounts that you've just declared are going to be protected by the state, and what you're describing in detail and specifically is going to act as an order to you.\nreceiver: Yes, there is none.\ncaller: Yes, yes, now finally, we will get a statement about a small operation, for example, he submitted that he has 1 million yuan in our bank account, but if the treasury confirms the amount of 6 million yuan, you will not be able to know the next amount for those 500 yuan, but because the 5 million yuan is an undeclared part, it can be judged as liquidation funds and proceed with the deposit clearance.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: Well, at this point in time, as I recall, there's not a huge margin of error, so I think it's going to be somewhere between a few and a few.\nreceiver: I know that there's about 500 of them, and I know there's between 500 and 1,000 of them.\ncaller: Now, if you're going to do it on your phone, it's going to be a little bit hard to find the bank on your phone.\nreceiver: It's not like I'm in charge of your finances, because my parents have a receipt, and frankly, they've never checked the receipt.\ncaller: But how could you possibly have guessed that it's a net worth of 500, when your parents are in charge?\nreceiver: But I've just been calculating that for a couple of years.\ncaller: He's been doing it for years.\nreceiver: It's been a year or two.\ncaller: That's how much you paid in two years.\nreceiver: What are you, 200 grand?\ncaller: You've paid about $200,000 over the last two years.\nreceiver: Yeah, my dad's the superintendent. Where'd you go to school?\ncaller: Yeah, well, the reason I keep asking these questions is so I don't avoid people.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Because it's a recording file, and if there's something unusual about it, and you say, \"I think it's about five million won\", and if there are tens of millions of won or more units in it, you can say that I didn't have a medical examination because you didn't declare the funds, because you were judged to be an illegal warehouse, and the National Treasury delayed the marriage.\nreceiver: But I'm so confused right now that I don't know what to say, and I'm going to have to check the bank statements of a new bank, not a corporate bank, which I can't verify.\ncaller: In the case of our bank, it's a little bit of a reserve instead.\nreceiver: Now we know exactly what happens in the case of our bank, which is 140 to the 130 to the 140.\ncaller: 130 to 1.3 million won, first of all, I want to help, but I'm in a hurry, so I don't even have the receipt, and my parents are holding the receipt right now, so I'm not sure if it's exactly 5 million won or 10 million won, so what should I do with this, so I asked again, yes, I got a little bit in the first place.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: And finally, if there's any change in what's already been said, or if there are any particulars that have been confirmed, you can get in touch with the detention center, and when you call us, we'll tell you that we've just been granted a search warrant, and we've contacted the public park with a cell phone number, but when you call you'll get the internal number, so if you confirm the particulars, that's not my responsibility, and I've told you that it's for your own reference.\nreceiver: Yeah, so you're getting calls from the county jail asking you all kinds of questions?\ncaller: Because, in the Gold Mine, there are 600,000 Koreans, half a million or 600,000?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're in charge of all those accounts, you're in the treasury, aren't you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But when we first get this statement, and then we file it, and we verify it at the gold mine, and it's not five million won, it's several tens of millions won, then you're obviously going to complain to us about that money, and you're going to lie to yourself and say that it's a counterfeit currency, and you add it to the Treasury, and that money is going to be damaged.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So I'm asking this specifically to help keep the perpetrator out of harm's way.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm going to start with the new bank receipts, and I'm just going to figure it out later, and then I'll ask the child custodian, and then you can give me an accurate answer.\ncaller: Oh yes, I understand. I'm the one who first recorded the recording, so I'm going to give it to you now that it's been recorded. Thank you for your cooperation in the class this morning, but it's very cold, so I think you should go to school and study.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

As a professional soldier, sickness is over, but the non-commissioned officer thinks that it's right to recruit noncombatants because it's sustainable for a long time. I think it's already been implemented. I think we should be lower than North Korea in terms of number of weapons, but that's not the case, because we are far ahead in terms of performance, and we have a situation where the United States has an embassy, and we're ready for it, so I think recruitment should have been defined already. I think that in the future we should work on training professionals who know how to handle some advanced weapons, and then there will also be jobs for professional soldiers, and naturally a lot of those jobs will be solved, and I think that's a good thing to see a training program in schools, so it's good to see\ncaller: Yeah, I think it's a good idea to start with a small-business salary when you first get in, and then gradually move up the ranks, and gradually work your way up to the level of a big business, so that you can support the military as a recruiter, which is a much smaller salary than in the general population, or something like that, who would support you, but even a little bit, you'd still like to be in the military, no matter how comfortable you are, but it's hard, and you have to be trained, and there's some kind of training at night, and it's probably the military, so you have to give your lieutenant a little bit more support than your regular civilian life, and then who will support you, and after a war, you have to fight in the first line, and that's why you have to have a higher salary than your civilian life.\nreceiver: And I think the answer to that question is already out there, because even if North Korea has a nuclear weapon, they're going to be using satellites to monitor their arsenic poisoning as soon as the door opens, so you can't threaten them with nuclear weapons, but that doesn't mean that we've responded in kind, and you can never make a nuclear weapon because if this goes off, it's the end of the world, anyway, and that's why North Korea can't use it in the Navy, and when you use it, you have to see that it's over. You're just talking too much on the air.\ncaller: Yes, yes, when you fire a nuclear weapon, there's damage on both sides, because you're shooting from the right side and you're firing from the wrong side, so you're going to end up destroying both sides anyway, because that's how powerful Japan was when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and Japan surrendered.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

One of them said that the decision to exempt from military service was canceled. The Military Service Department reported the results of a service status check on 60 people who had completed a face-to-face examination of 85 people in the field of art or physical activity in the Committee for the Improvement of the Special System of Military Service of the National Assembly on the 21st. Of the 60 soldiers, 31 reported false information related to their service activities, six of whom said that they had not submitted actual service activities. Another fourteen said that their service hours had been exaggerated, and another eleven said that they would have been warned if they had time to travel to their place of duty, as if they thought that there was a golden medal or a gold medal for moving to another place of duty. As an investigator, one of the 544 soldiers had been warned that when calculating the hours of compulsory service, the behavior of the soldier should include\nreceiver: I also read this article that you said that this investigation is being carried out jointly by the Military Department and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Deputy Commissioner for the Improvement of the Military Special System, the Right-Wing Party Member of Parliament, said that this part of the investigation should be investigated because it is similar to the submission of false factual data based on the amount of time spent in this allegation.\ncaller: No, I also learned from this article that you have to do your court service, including winning a gold medal, and it's the same thing when military athletes go into the military, there's about a two-year gap, but think about it, that's a devastating blow for an athlete or an artist, so they think that athletes and artists are avoiding military service because they know that, but it's too cowardly to think that if you don't do your legal service, you're not going into the military.\nreceiver: I agree with you, sweating a gold medal to raise the profile of my career and my country is right, but I think that the army and all the other rewards are to replace it with service time instead of going to the army, but I find it very disappointing that you try to solve this by lying, exaggerating this service time and submitting a service record that you did not actually do, because if you go to the army as you say there are problems in your career because you have a problem in your country and you think you have created this special sickness system in a way that protects you, I think it's really cowardly that you don't even think about it, so I think we should properly investigate 85 more people in the last investigation and give them another punishment, like the veteran football player who received military privileges, if he expands his service time and becomes a permanent member of the team, his career will end here.\ncaller: Well, that's what I'm thinking, and I think that if the country, in order to protect the careers of artists and athletes, allows them to train, practice or compete intermittently for about two years of military service, then it would make it much easier for athletes and artists to do military service, and if there's a lot of support for that kind of training and there's such a law, then not only current military athletes, but future artistic athletes could go into the military with a lot more ease, and you think that there should be some kind of policy to prevent this from happening.\nreceiver: I think, like you, that there are very few athletes who win a gold or a medal in the first place, and I think it's very bad for the future of our country that the rest of the athletes do not win a medal and have to go to the army.\ncaller: Well, I think we need to support the people who are in the military, but I also think that we want to punish the deserters more severely, not just with fines, but with a little more severe punishment, so that they don't evade the military. Of course, this isn't the only way, but it's also a good way, and if you give a little more training or activism, I believe that the future activist artists of our country will see the light in a much better environment in the army or in life.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How can I help you?\ncaller: Yeah, hi. I was wondering about the house cleaning deposit. Do you have a wired consult?\ncaller: I'm a home improvement mortgage subscriber, and I've been told that you can also get a public housing mortgage, and I know that the Korean Land Corporation is building public housing, but is it really possible to get a private mortgage on this type of property?\ncaller: Okay, well, I was wondering if I could change my name to another family member's name, because it says that only death by inheritance or resurrection can change my name.\nreceiver: It's not possible.\ncaller: Yeah, I can't do that, because I'm going to have to do an income tax, and I've got a contract savings account, and I don't have a mortgage, but if I do, I want it to be an income tax.\ncaller: And that's only for my name, not even my immediate family, whether or not I represent them.\ncaller: And then, my mortgage was sold off, so I'm trying to sign up for a new mortgage savings account at CS Bank, but can I sign up online without visiting?\ncaller: Oh, you can do it on the Internet. I'll have to look it up on the website. Do I have to go to the bank for the deposit itself? I want to minimize the hassle of having to go there every time to process the deposit.\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: You can do it through other banks, automated machines, Internet banking?\ncaller: That's very convenient.

I heard that CS Bank has this kind of service, and I thought it was a little different from other banks, so I got interested.\ncaller: Like it says here, if you sign up, you can't see the transaction without my approval or the store manager's approval?\ncaller: So I'm going to have to register a number of wallets in front of me in the safe account registry, so that I can register all the wallets that I use.\ncaller: So after signing up for an account, when you use an account, the process is that I have to go in and submit my citizenship card, and then the store manager has to verify that I can open an account or make payments, and no one else can see my citizenship cards.\ncaller: I'm guessing you'll need to verify your identity to sign up for a safe account, so why don't you visit the branch?\ncaller: Well, I'm sure I'd feel comfortable visiting and dealing with it, so I'll just have to sign up online for the mortgage, and the savings account will slowly go to the branch, and we'll move on.\ncaller: What about the paperwork?\ncaller: You're just going to bring your ID, a copy, or proof of family ties, a certificate of appreciation, of appreciation?\ncaller: What's the deadline for filing?

I'm still a little bit more idealistic. This is good, this is good.\nreceiver: I really don't want to focus on this because it's an uncomfortable subject, and I just want to keep it quiet, but now there's this novelist, Mr. Taemin-hee, and there's someone else, a foreigner, Professor Chris Lee, who has just left the United States, and he's a Korean-American, so he's writing a book about how I became a North Korean, and the chaos and violence that the defectors are going through, and coming from another world and settling in another country, and it's not very easy for us, you know, moving to any area, but I live in Seoul, and now I've moved to Daegu, and I've seen the news, and even if I colour the local area like this, I've never felt this symbolically when I've just done it, but it's really different because I've lived in the Daegu area of Seoul all my life.\ncaller: What did you feel differently?\nreceiver: So it's a little bit like this, a little bit of this, a bit of that, and so there's a part of me that feels like I'm a bit of a stranger, and this is just going from region to region, but it's going from country to country, and right now, it's like with the defectors, you've come to another country where you live, and it's not going to be easy to settle in, but it doesn't seem to be.\ncaller: But you have to settle down and live your life with a little bit of help, so for the rest of your life, at first because of this help, you just consume it, and then maybe now this is an investment and becomes an investment in yourself to build the strength that you can support yourself here, so maybe you should change it to such a program, but anyway, when the defectors come, it's settlement funds, so I know that you support house to house or something like that, and that's after a few years, where the defector news is hard to live with, and there are many cases where it's a little bit bad because of this, of course, the things that come out of the synthetic news are news, and we can only remember those things, but of course there are people who succeed and settle down well, but then I think that maybe we should not make such investments to live here again as a new member of society.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

You may be confused at first, but let me explain the situation.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: Now, we've uncovered a criminal use of an account opened in Mr. Iyadjin's name, which appears to have been recently used as a storage facility for illicit financial transactions.\ncaller: The tank commander?\nreceiver: Yes, it appears that Mr. Iandjin's information has been misused, because there have been a lot of similar cases recently, where criminal organizations have used your accounts to launder money and transfer illegal funds.\ncaller: Oh, yeah.\nreceiver: This could put you in legal trouble, and I think we need to take action now.\ncaller: What kind of stimulus?\nreceiver: It's one of our official investigations, and we need to act quickly, but in this situation, it's more important than ever to protect Mr. Yang's account from being implicated in a crime, so I think we need to freeze his account for a while, and keep all his funds safe.\ncaller: What's the matter with you?\nreceiver: So don't worry too much, your funds will be safe, and we recommend that you withdraw the funds from your account first, and then transfer them directly to the financial controller, who will take care of your funds and return them to you after all the risks have been eliminated.\ncaller: Directly to the CFO's staff?\nreceiver: Yes, Mr. Iandjin, this is the safest way, the only way to protect the funds in the current situation, because if the funds are used for crime, there could be bigger legal problems, and it's the safest thing to do to protect the assets of Mr. Iadjin.\ncaller: Okay, so I'm going to go to the bank right now and withdraw it, but this is really safe, right?\nreceiver: Of course, Mr. Iandjin, as people who work for a government agency, protecting your client's assets is our top priority, so if you contact us right after the withdrawal, we'll have a member of the Financial Supervisory Authority personally come to you and safely manage your funds, and if you have any questions, please let us know at any time.\ncaller: I'll call you when I get to the bank.\nreceiver: Thank you, Mr. Iandjin, for your cooperation, and I think we'll be able to resolve the issue quickly. If you contact us immediately after the withdrawal from the bank, the staff of the Financial Supervisory Authority will guide you, so don't worry too much, and please refrain from talking to outsiders as much as possible until the case is closed.\ncaller: Yeah, I got it.\nreceiver: Thank you, Mr. Iandjin. We are waiting for you at any time, please contact us immediately, and be sure to go to the bank and withdraw it yourself, and never tell anyone else, as this is a way to protect yourself.\ncaller: Yes, I see.

Can I get a separate text message with the interest payment instructions or the interest rate changes?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Do I need to file a separate document to get a subprime mortgage?\ncaller: Does it have to be a certificate of eligibility, a certificate of payment for the National Health Insurance?\ncaller: Do you have any idea what time it is to apply for a loan?\nreceiver: It's available from 6:00 to 23:00.\ncaller: If I apply today, can I confirm the results right away?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: How long will it take?\nreceiver: You have a valid ID, right?\nreceiver: If you have a valid ID, you can do it in five minutes.\ncaller: If you can get a loan, do you have to make a deposit today?\ncaller: You said you could extend it for one year, but in the case of a fixed-term extension, how many years can you extend it?\nreceiver: It can be renewed for up to 10 years on a one-year basis.\ncaller: Is the repayment method a time-delayed repayment?\ncaller: The affidavit says that if you have a valid certificate, you can submit it automatically, right?\ncaller: If I apply on my mobile, can I do it face-to-face?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Does it matter if there's an exit?\ncaller: What about a subprime mortgage?\nreceiver: It's a temporary replacement.\ncaller: Can we set this payment date?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: I only take out what I need, and when I don't use the money, there's no interest?\nreceiver: There's no interest when you don't use your money.\ncaller: Yes, thank you for your confirmation. You said it's face-to-face, but do you have an online loan agreement?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is there any chance it won't be renewed after the expiration date?\ncaller: Do you need any papers for the extension?\ncaller: Can I extend it if I don't have the same duration or the same conditions as the first time I use it?\ncaller: Can I apply for an extension face-to-face?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Couldn't you use the loan money as an account manager at another bank?\ncaller: If I want to pay it back before the due date, you said there's no penalty, how much interest do I have to pay?\nreceiver: If you pay it back, it's just the loan amount and the interest that you used before you paid it back.\ncaller: Is there any way to check the negative balance and then check the credit balance?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Can I choose A2 after I've done it all?\nreceiver: It is possible.\ncaller: Is it possible to check the interest rate while checking the limit?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: You said it's available from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. 365 days a year?\nreceiver: You have 365 days.\ncaller: Is it possible to get a general credit loan in addition to a negative principal loan?\nreceiver: It's possible if you have four life insurance policies.\ncaller: But what's the difference between a negative principal and a loan other than interest payments?\nreceiver: A credit line has a low interest rate and a high limit, whereas a negative statement has a high interest rate and low limit.\ncaller: Yes, thank you. I'll think about it and get back to you.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.

Who are you?\ncaller: I'm a foreign prosecutor with the Financial Crimes Unit of the Seoul Central Bureau of Investigation, and I've been contacted about an important case involving Mr. Park Jong-min, whose account is being investigated urgently due to allegations of financial crimes.\nreceiver: I don't think that's going to happen.\ncaller: I'm not saying that Mr. Park Jong-min was directly involved, but the list of accounts used in the recent money laundering includes an account in Mr. Park's name, which is currently under investigation, so we're conducting a simple investigation by wire to clarify this situation.\nreceiver: I've never been involved in anything like that.\ncaller: First of all, we are investigating to verify the innocence of Mr. Park Chung-min, so don't worry, just answer the facts. If there are no allegations after the preliminary investigation, there is no need for further investigation. However, if the situation becomes serious, we can issue a formal subpoena or a warrant, please cooperate.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: First, I'm going to need some basic identification, like your social security number and the name of the bank you use most often.\nreceiver: Wait a minute, is it okay if I tell you this over the phone?\ncaller: Mr. Park Chung-min, I fully understand your concerns, there's a lot of voice-spying going on these days, and we're cautious about this process, but now that we have suspicions that your account is involved in a crime, you need to cooperate and we can investigate quickly, because this information is strictly confidential and will only be used for investigative purposes, and if you don't follow this procedure, you could be at a disadvantage.\nreceiver: I see.\ncaller: Can you tell me your social security number first?\nreceiver: This is 830319-2861113.\ncaller: 830319-2861113 is that correct?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, where is your client's bank?\nreceiver: The People's Bank.\ncaller: Yes, thank you. Now I need to check the balance of Mr. Park Jong-min's account, and can you tell me how many bank accounts he is currently using, and roughly how much money is in each account?\nreceiver: There's one in the national bank, and there's another one in the bank.\ncaller: How long are you staying?\nreceiver: There's about 50 million won in the National Bank, 30 million won in one bank.\ncaller: Yes, confirmed. Mr. Park Jung Min, if the investigation finds that Mr. Park Jong Min's account was not used in a crime, the charges will be dismissed immediately, but we will need to conduct further investigation based on this information. Have you recently shared your account information or social security number with anyone?\nreceiver: No, I never did.\ncaller: If so, that's great, but we've recently discovered suspicious transactions in Mr. Park's account, and we need to investigate further.\nreceiver: It's a lot of money, but I don't remember much about it.\ncaller: So we're going to take another look at your recent transactions, and since you don't have anything to do right now, we'll get back to you as soon as we have the results, and if you have any further questions, please contact us anytime.\nreceiver: Yes, I see. Thank you.\ncaller: No, we would like to thank you for your cooperation. If there are no problems with the investigation, this case will be closed soon.

So what should I say? There's a part of me that I don't have, or maybe there's something I'm embarrassed about that I haven't expressed, so why don't you do it?

So, for example, where to go today, and I'm so worried about something, let's meet these three people, and it's nice to be stressed out, but I'm worried about things like where to go, what to eat, what to do, and what you're doing.\ncaller: There's a fish that I've had a lot of dates with, but one of them was kind of fun, and it was actually kind of fun for most people, and I knew that, but it was one of the things that I didn't really want to do, and that's what it was, that name2 and name3 and Lotteworld had and they were borrowing the suit and playing with it, so I was kind of curious about why I hated the suit a little bit, but I always thought about it, and then I just wanted to see that show, and I thought, oh, well, maybe I've graduated from high school and I don't have that aversion to the suit anymore, but it's kind of fun to look at it, and it's sort of like, you know, if you're going out there and you're wearing a dress that's a little bit old, you're not going to have to wear it, because you're a little bit older than me, and you've got a little bit of a problem with it, and I'm kind of borrowing it.\nreceiver: Instead of being interesting and fun, I've become very reflective by looking at it, and now I've been given a month's time for those people who don't have a month. It's only a month. In that month, I have to find something that matches me, and I have to figure out if the person I'm attracted to is attracted to me as well, and I don't get many chances to do that, because there's a limit to how many times I can go out with them, or how often I can act like that, and that's probably why I'm always attracted to them. They talk a lot about when they're going on a date or going somewhere together. It was the same yesterday. I came in here, and after a while, I had a change of heart, and I asked this question, and it's no big deal. I thought it was time for me to reflect. I always thought that if I had to ask that question, I could get caught up in the mood, and I'd have to come up with some sort of serious story, but now I'm trying to figure it out.

Well, now it's a little shorter, and it's changed to a year and six months, but frankly I think that if you can't go, you cannot go, but now you have to go, and now you have people who are going, and now there are people who are sick, and now they're not covered, so people who are not covered by the military exemption know that, of course, now they have to be criticized and they're being abused, but somehow it's understandable.\ncaller: And I, of course, wouldn't go into the army if I was eligible for the privilege of enlisting, because the army, as I've said before, is a very dangerous, organized, rigorous place, and I think very few people would want to go, and I don't want to go either, but if I'm in a situation where I'm physically healthy and mentally healthy enough to go, I think I'll go without hesitation, and even if it's not a question of enlistment, one of the other main issues that we're going to talk about in this article is volunteer hours, and these days, volunteering has become an obligation rather than a service.\nreceiver: Volunteering is like this, you're forced to do something because you want to do something, you have to do it, and it's good to have a lot of time for volunteering, because people have no choice, and this is something that I really don't like to see in a bad light, but there's something like that, because you're forcing them to go there, and instead they're doing damage, and they're going to go to the elderly welfare facility, and they are going to go and harass their grandparents, and then they'll take a video and put it up on Essence, and you can't go to the service, and you're a volunteer, and you have to be part of the benefits, or you're part of the compulsion, and I think you have to walk a little bit, and I don't think I've ever thought of a way to do that, but I think I'll have to do more research and think and come up with a solution.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

with the Sharing Securities, and I called to find out how to open an account.\nreceiver: Please provide your full name, contact information, and social security number.\ncaller: I'm not sure if it's the same for all banks, but it's different for each product, so you can open stock and mutual fund accounts at any bank, and you can only open stock accounts at Sharing Bank and Korea Bank.\ncaller: And the futures and options account is available in the sharing bank, but the other banks have to be verified by each bank, it varies from bank to bank.\ncaller: I'm just going to try to invest in stocks, and once I'm done with stocks and I have some confidence in investing, I plan to invest in futures, but it's still too difficult, so I'm going to start with stocks.\ncaller: If you can open a securities account in a share bank, you can also open an overseas equity account, so I think you should open a security account in a sharing bank, because you can then trade futures and options, as well as overseas equities.\ncaller: So you open a securities account at a partner bank, and then you open a stock account in the app store of a sharing securities broker, and you open an account and you use it.\ncaller: I'd have to open a securities account, download the Craigslist app, use my phone in my name, and verify my identity.\ncaller: You can choose which product you want to open, and there's multiple overlapping options, not just a stock exchange account, but a CMA account, or a securities account, all at once.\ncaller: I'm going to register my personal information and my investment preferences, and then I'll do an investment preference analysis, and then we'll go through the registration process, and I'll set up my account number and my ID, and I will be certified to open a securities account with a sharing bank, and then the application for an equity account is complete.\ncaller: How do you transfer funds from a new stock exchange account to a stock exchange account in order to actually trade shares?\ncaller: I think you can buy stocks that you want to buy, and then transfer them from your bank account to your securities account, just like with Internet banking.\ncaller: You can transfer it to a securities account and buy the shares you're interested in.\ncaller: So if you're going to do a bank-to-business exchange, you have to do it during the business hours of a commercial bank, because the hours of the banks are a little different from the hours of stock exchanges, so you have to know exactly what time you're trading.\ncaller: You have to do it during business hours, because it's difficult to do it, and I'd like you to speak slowly so that you can explain it exactly one more time, so I can take notes.\ncaller: If you choose an overseas securities product, deposit your currency into a securities account, and then go to the overseas category, click \"Currency Exchange\" and click \"Buy Currency Exchange\", you'll be able to make a direct exchange.\ncaller: If you're making a transaction directly through the app, you're also exempt from the redemption fee, because it's for the duration of the event.\ncaller: You said that during the event, you're exempt, and afterwards, if you redeem it online, you can redeem it with a 90% to 95% discount.\ncaller: But I think it's a bit risky to trade stocks from developed countries, because there's a lot of customers in the U.S. stock market, and there's also a service where you can order them directly for pennies.\ncaller: You're saying that U.S. stocks are a service where you place an order in the original currency without a conversion, and the next day you automatically convert as much foreign currency as you need, at a conversion discount rate that's even lower than if you were to convert directly.\ncaller: That's great, but you have to apply for this service in advance.\ncaller: Is it possible to transfer funds from a stock trading account to a bank withdrawal account when the return on the investment is at the level I was aiming for, and if you want to withdraw the funds without reinvesting them after the swap?\ncaller: So when I swap my stock account, when I get my money back, I can transfer it directly to my checking account, and when I go to the banking home in the Craigslist app, they explain the transfer guidelines, so I'll take a look.\ncaller: If you go into the banking home category, you say there's an asset management company that can track my U balances, my stocks, my cash balances.\ncaller: It's very easy to transfer from a securities account in a banking house to a regular account in a partner bank, but it's very simple to trade securities when you first open the securities account and then you open the stock account, but what you buy is very important.\ncaller: I've just opened a securities account. Thank you for your help.\nreceiver: Thank you.\ncaller: I think we should look more closely at the investment products, given that there are some free-of-charge products in securities accounts.\nreceiver: Do you have any other questions?\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: Thank you.

classify: <conversation>\ncaller: I remember being bitten by a dog when I was a kid, and I don't really like dogs, but these days, when you go for a walk or go hiking, there are a lot of people who bring their pets with them, and if you have any pets, what kind of pets do you have, how do you keep them?\nreceiver: I have a dog, and it's a Pomeranian, and my mother didn't like dogs that passed by, and now that I've brought them home, they're cute, and now she likes them, and I think the whole family's on the same page, because you don't like other animals either.\ncaller: I'm a little reluctant to keep them at home, because there are a lot of people in my family who are allergic to them, and I remember having a little bit of trouble with them every time I go fishing, so you keep them indoors now, but in the past, we used to have these big kinds of dogs, like house dogs or house dogs, but every time I went fishing, my husband was a little bit allergic, and the kids were a little bit, so it was hard to keep them for a long time, but the kids grew up, and the memories of having dogs stayed with me for a very long time, so it's nice to have a dog or a pet when I was a kid, and sometimes my husband wants to try to keep a bird, but he's trying to keep a fish, and we're trying to get rid of some birds in the mountains, and our house has a garden, so I want to keep fish in the backyard, and I'm trying to keep the fish out of the water, but I'm worried about keeping half of the animals out of the backyard.\nreceiver: I think it's possible to hate pets, dogs, cats, etc. I'm a dog person, but I think other people might not like them, so I always take people in elevators or walk with them, and I always carry them so that the dog doesn't walk towards them, and then I walk behind them, so that they don't walk toward me, and I think that to live like this, I need to take care of other people, so I'm always on a leash, and I don't ever let go of a leash for the sake of others, and I would love to see a change in the fishery law to make leashes mandatory, and if you're familiar with the law on pets, do you think you need a mouthpiece, or do you think that's okay?\ncaller: I've never really thought about the pet-fishing laws, but I've always thought that when I'm out walking, there's no such thing as a big animal, like a dog or a cat, that's the size of a third or fourth grade elementary school student, but if it's a puppy, it's that big, so it's probably going to have a little bit of a mouth, or something like that, because it's too small, or it's medium, and it's kind of close to a small dog, but you don't have to do it, or you've trained your puppy well enough to get it out, or you have a person like I just said, and you look at the puppy in the opposite direction, or you go up in an elevator, and you're not going to do that, but it's going to be very rude to your neighbors, and I don't think it's right to open your mouth to fish, but then again, it doesn't feel good for a large dog or cat, and I'm really trying to get my imagination out of the idea that\nreceiver: I have a four-year-old puppy, and the average life expectancy of a puppy is 12 years, and our family always expects that they'll die sooner than we do, and I'm okay with me and my dad, but my mom used to hate pets, and now that I think about it, she loves them more than anyone else, so I think she's going to get depressed later, and my dad and I worry about her more than the death of the puppy, so if the puppy goes to heaven, we try to think of a hobby like bringing a new puppy or being a companion to the mother, and we spend a lot of money on it, so our son doesn't save any money every time the puppy gets a little bit sick, and we invest in it, and we make our family look worse, and I think it's sad that the puppy is gone, but I think we're going to be able to embrace it even more.\ncaller: Because we're a family, and because we're living creatures, we can get sick enough, and so we don't take our sick family to the hospital, and I don't think we deserve to use the word \"family\", and so if an animal is sick, we have to take it home, or not take it home but take it to the hospital and treat it and take care of it, and I think it's a sense of obligation and responsibility that we have within the family to take care of each other.\nreceiver: Yeah, I was grooming a puppy, and the dog groomer dropped it, and it broke its leg, and it had to be operated on, and my parents said they didn't want to take money from the groomer, and that the family was injured, and that compensation felt like money to bury, so my parents didn't ask the groomer for any money at all, and they paid for it privately, and the surgery cost the puppy about two million dollars, and my mother said it didn't matter, and now that the dog's legs are healed and she's running around, it doesn't matter that the two million dollars aren't missing, because people are feeding their cats a lot these days, and every cat has grown a lot longer, and they've had a lot of difficulty breaking down, but what do you think about people who feed their pets or grow their pets' bodies?\ncaller: At first, I had a very negative feeling about the cats, because there were a lot of cars in our neighborhood, and there was a lot of cats under the cars, and I asked my husband about it, and he said that the engine was warm, so the cats would go in there a lot, but what I always thought was that people would start walking in the morning and they'd be worried that the cats wouldn't get hit, and that was my unnecessary worry, and the cats were going to move to another place in the morning, and if the cats didn't have people to feed them, they would become garbage bags, and the neighborhood would be more messy and dirty, and the school would be run down, and then I started talking about how grateful I was to the people who fed the cats.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Of course I won't. You and me, now that you're worried about me, and I'm driving, and John Joly's worried about you, I did this.\ncaller: Well, yeah, you're right, but, uh, I think that's right, because this is the first time we've been on a trip together, and I think the chairs have gotten more expensive, and there's been a lot of crazy stuff, and we've gotten through all of that, and we go to our barbecue barbecue, and, uh, we don't have a pot, and then we're like, how do you eat a bagel, and you pack a loaf of bread, and a silverware, and you put a fire in it, and you eat it, and that's why the men's chairs are bigger?\nreceiver: That's it, that's all, now men go and keep their chairs and make memories, because they've traveled, they're memories, but now you don't have to go anywhere else, not just in the country, but every time you come, every time you drink, every time.\ncaller: The Philippines, honestly, it's cheap, and it's expensive, and honestly, I think it's good for me to go there, because there's a lot of activities, and the food is cheap, and the street holidays are popular, because four men go there, and I honestly think I can live a perfectly luxurious life with a million dollars, but you've been to the Philippines this time, and I see the photos, I just played in the river, and what a strange thing, and I said, \"There's lots of activity, but if you go there, there's some activity\".\nreceiver: Well, there's a lot of activity in the philippines. There's also a lot of diving in the Philippines. It's just kind of like going on a tour. You know, you go and see fish. Or you go to places like the Philippines. They're called the Oslops.\ncaller: It's nice to hear what you're saying, but when I travel abroad, I worry about food and water, and I'm probably counting spices, and we don't have a good flavor, so a lot of people are looking for seasoning.\nreceiver: To be honest, I've been thinking a little bit about the food in that country before I went there. It's a little bit different from our country. First of all, it's different from spices, so I'm a little bit worried about it, and I'm trying to buy a lot of kimchi or something like that in Korea, but now it's not easy, because I'm traveling for seven days in the Philippines.\ncaller: But I'm a little worried about the security in the southeast, because it's legal to have guns in places like the Philippines, and I'm actually a bit worried about security in the Philippines, because there are some incidents where people from my country get hurt, and I don't know when I've heard that there's a lot of security around tourist spots, but I'm really worried about security, because I've been to all the places you've been.\nreceiver: I've been thinking a lot about where I want to go in the Philippines before I go, and I've always wanted a vacation card, and there's a lot of beaches and stuff, but it's okay to be a tourist, and I know a lot about taxes, and there are a lot of shootings and things, and Koreans go out and get shot and they die, and so there's lots of stuff like that, but really, I'm just going to ask people who have been around me and things like that, or the Neighborhood, and I just looked it up, and it's all good, and everybody said, \"Well, when you're traveling, you can't just go down the alley, you can just go down an alley, it's a little bit dangerous, because there's so many people traveling, there are so many foreigners, there's not only Koreans, but there's also a lot of westerners and other people from other countries, so you don't have to worry about that.\ncaller: Other countries are also good, so I haven't been abroad yet, so I've looked a little bit for Japan, which is a good place for people from my country to go for the first time, but in cases like Japan, it's a little expensive, because it's expensive, and then the Korean market is so developed, so it doesn't feel like you've been to Japan.\nreceiver: I haven't been to Japan yet, but I'm thinking the same thing as you. I've always wanted to go to Japan. Originally, I was thinking a lot about going to Japan or going to the Philippines. But then I thought the same as you.\ncaller: When I go to Taiwan in the winter, I think I like Taiwan, but I don't really know much about Taiwan, and I don' t know if there are any great destinations there, but I've been thinking about travel destinations, and I've also been thinking a lot about traveling to Europe, such as the Czech Republic or Vladivostok or Eastern Europe, where the price is good, but now it' s cheaper, the price is also good, and now the scenery is nice, and you can get a taste of Europe for a cheap price.\nreceiver: In the winter, but I'm a little different from you. Well, I'm cold in the winter. When it's cold in Korea, you have to go to a warm country. I think when it's hot you have to move to a cold country. So I'm going to Russia in the winter, and that doesn't feel right to me.\ncaller: But I think you're right, and I also think it's not a great thing to go to a cold place in the winter, and as you said, we are four men, and we don't take pictures in museums, or landscapes, or on bridges, but like you said, I think we should enjoy some leisure sports or active things, so I don't have anywhere to go around here, but lately, because of the coronavirus, I'm a little stressed to go to Southeast Asia.\nreceiver: I don't know what's in Japan, and I'm not sure if there's any merit in going to Japan, so if you go to a place called Okinawa, you have no idea what's there, so I think you're going to have to explain a little bit.\ncaller: I don't know what's in Okinawa, but if you're going to travel abroad in Japan, it's okay to go abroad in the first place. It's okay for people in our country to have a culture, and to some extent, Japanese has a bunch of words that we know from living in our country as well, because there's that, and then there's school transportation, which is convenient, and maybe even much better in cases like security, and I also spoke Japanese, but uh, I just said that the island is famous, mainly because I want to go to Japan personally, and there's a reason why I said before, and then we go by ourselves, and if you go to Japan, you go to a town or a village or a Naruto village, but I want to do that.\nreceiver: Okay, okay, Japan, I'm a little bit of that too, I agree with that.

There is a rumor saying that we should abolish this privilege because of the decrease in the number of troops going to active duty. This is a very funny story, but military service is mandatory for every Korean citizen, so it should be specified in the country, because there is no question of how this can be done, but it is not possible to refuse it, so if there is a shortage of active service, it should be abolished.

I'd say that I am happy, because there have been a lot of sad days in the countless days that I look back on, but there are a lot of times when I'm still having a hard time with my family, and there's a lot of hard times, but I'm just trying to find happiness in this, and I think that somehow, there are days that are not happy, and there are happy days, but I feel like I'm living and I'm very grateful that I live like this, and it's not because I didn't get married.\nreceiver: I guess you could say it's half-way. Some days you're happy and some days are bad, some days you feel like you should or shouldn't be doing this, and then you get better and then you fight, and then at some point you start fighting again, and that's what marriage is all about, and I feel like I'm just going through it, because I see people getting divorced, and they can't stand the moment of not understanding each other, and I wish they hadn't gotten divorced because there's a little bit of a lack of care for each other, rather than a lack of understanding. There's a lot of celibacy these days, and I say no, but if you raise your hand, it's better to try it once in a while, because living and not being married doesn't make me feel half-way good or half-way bad, but being married is the same thing. I just want to let you know that it's not too late to regret having experienced more than you did before deciding to do anything.\ncaller: I feel like I'm growing up with them, and I feel like the love I got from my parents is deeper and more profound, and it's the motivation to get through the tough stuff, but sometimes when you're older like me, you can get to an age where you don't know what your parents are thinking, and that's kind of a half-baked idea, and I think it's better to date a lot or date a little and get married. What do you think?\nreceiver: I think it's a good idea to date a lot, because I'm on the wrong side of the fence, but that's what I tell my friends underneath my bed, that it's good to meet a lot of people, to meet a couple of people and get married, and to meet ten people and twenty people and then get married, that's really crazy, because to do anything and get married and have no regrets later, no refinement, once I said yes, when you can have fun, you should have fun, and then why didn't you want to do that? This guy should have met all those people, but he shouldn't have met more than a dozen people, right? What do you think?\ncaller: You might think that, but I haven't been in a relationship as much as name2 has, and this is just my personal opinion, and I'm wondering if maybe meeting someone and getting married doesn't make you happy by meeting lots of people, and if you've dated ten times, if you're dating twenty times, you have to meet the person you really love, but you're happy, like, even if you only date once, and it's just that dating or getting married is a responsibility, and when you meet this person, it's a responsibility for what I choose, and responsibility for the choice, and love and duty, and I don't get divorced when I get married, because that's what I thought about getting married in the first place.\nreceiver: And I think that's a half-truth, too, because you don't know what people do, and you can't make a decision about it, and you shouldn't feel like you have to go all the way, and you've got to get married, but you never know what's going to happen to people, and that's another thing, but I don't think anyone wants to get divorced, and I think that the queen said that people who don't have much dating experience get divorced a lot.\ncaller: I remember some people, but it's just a little bit of a vivid memory, and I don't know if I can call it love, because I'm probably the type of person who thinks too deeply, and the only person I really love is my husband, and I think the more I date, the better, but I haven't dated very much, and I'm lucky enough to have never dated, but I've married well, and maybe I won't be able to get married again in the future.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I don't know about that, because I've heard that coins are dangerous too.\ncaller: Well, there's a lot of talk these days that the coin market is volatile, but we have a strategy that allows us to generate stable returns, which is different from conventional investments, which are managed by our experts, so you can expect high returns while minimizing risk.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: It's not really your target audience, it's just the people that we're talking to who are doing this type of compensation.\nreceiver: Oh, is that right?\ncaller: You've probably already been rewarded for losing once, but this is what we're doing to help you get back on track.\nreceiver: Well, I'm a little nervous about what might happen if this goes wrong.\ncaller: Mr. Kim Young-woo, that's why we're with you, because you're not doing it yourself, we're managing a large part of it for you, and because this investment is done with the compensation you've received, it doesn't affect any of the assets you already have, so you don't have to be overwhelmed, and this is an opportunity that you might miss out on.\nreceiver: Oh, is that so?\ncaller: Yeah, we can't force it any more because we're supposed to be helping, but it's unfortunate, because there's no guarantee that it's going to be reimbursed, and you'd be much better off letting professionals manage it in the first place.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: If you have any questions about the specs, our experts can text or email you at any time, so please leave a message at the end of the call if you'd like.\nreceiver: Okay, so how do we send the money?\ncaller: It's not a complicated process, so listen carefully and follow through, and you can transfer the $100 million that's in your account right now to our designated investment account, and our team of experts will process the investment right away, and report back to you in real time.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: The results will be sent to both text and e-mail, do you have a route you'd like to follow?\nreceiver: No, I think texting and e-mailing is fine.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: I'll send you the account number, you can wire it to that account, and we'll do our best to keep your assets safe.\nreceiver: Give me the account number.\ncaller: This is 983-09925-255.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: We have confirmed the transfer, Mr. Kim Young-woo.

Let's just go back to our high school days, you know what I mean, but honestly, when I was in high school, the only thing I remember eating was you.\nreceiver: Of course, it was the other half of us, and we always went to eat something after the yaja, and that's what it was then, or is it Jungsun Shabu Shabu? After eating it, I went to buy milk when I was hungry at the yaja and you didn't go to buy something, but then our letters weren't received very much.\ncaller: Can you call it a letter? It's a letter, it's a note, every day, and it's thrown away in a day, unless you're collecting it.\nreceiver: Of course, I know how many times you and I have moved, and I put it in the drawer and I've kept it exactly as it is, and I'm so disappointed that you didn't throw it away.\ncaller: Oh, I'm sorry, but I wish I'd been dumped in front of you, because we had so much junk, so much stuff, and when I think about it, all we ever do is eat whatever we want to eat, and we always bought milk before we started eating, and we used to buy a lot of milk back then, and why don't we both look that tall?\nreceiver: Now I'm tall, now I'm big, now I can't get any bigger, so I'm fat, but really, when I think about it, I think I'm less fat than what I ate, and when I look back, I think that I really ate a lot, but that school, we're in school, that's a little bit of college, this is just school, you know, it's not like you have to be there from morning to night, but high school is now from morning to evening, so I don't know, I guess I'm getting a lot of physical exhaustion, so now I have to instinctively find something to eat, don't you think?\ncaller: Yeah, and now that I think about it, we used to pretend like we didn't care about school when we were in high school, but I guess we got ripped off because we couldn't get rid of the stress by eating.\nreceiver: I didn't study much, but I still remember that you put it in English at that time, and you're like, what's a magisterium or something, and you bought one of those red things, and then all of a sudden you opened it, and I bought it, and you got mad at me, and you didn't tell me in advance why you couldn't solve all of these things.\ncaller: Oh, I remember that motivational kid in my English scores that at first, oh, why did you solve it? Why did you just solve it? I thought about it, but later I found out that it was the biggest help.\nreceiver: Of course, I'm a linguist, but I'm not very good at languages either, and I just want to do what I normally do, and I'm like, I didn't really study hard when I was in high school, and I don't remember studying hard, because I just do what I used to do.\ncaller: I think I had a really good time at sixth grade, and I was really good at ninth, and then I got really good at second grade, and the subjects I was good at were really good, and the ones I was bad at were really bad, and I didn't think my native language would betray me like that, especially the Huruk native language.\nreceiver: You know, I'm still a rookie, but I'd like to think I'm right, because I'm good at languages, and now you've switched from English to math, and I'm really shocked.\ncaller: English, math, uh, that's a bit of a red herring, isn't it?\nreceiver: We're the last generation that doesn't do geometry, geometry and vectors, so you don't want to do that, so you're thinking about arithmetic.\ncaller: Uh, I've been thinking a lot about the score going back and forth between you and Yoran, and your mother was once desperately dry, and you're never going to be able to recover your character, and there's a part of me that's kind of sympathetic to that, and I didn't recover it, and now that I think about it, I think you made a pretty good choice at the time, and we're not, uh, recovering our character, either.\nreceiver: It's the same as G3 anyway, because the result is the same. Oh, I really suddenly remember that in my secondary school, you don't know, but there was this Japanese chicken, because there was a Japanese chicken and for some reason, when I was in middle school, I really hated that the chickens ate something in the classroom. Yes, the Japanese chicken came one day, and in the class, I still remember the choice of words, sweet smell, sweet smell.\ncaller: I think that's the difference between private and public schools, because we still rotate every five years, and there's this one guy who's really scary, and he's not that crazy, and you're really going on and on, and it's a private school, so there's a lot of scary kids, especially in middle school and high school, so you're like, what's the best teacher in the city?\nreceiver: I think it's better if it's really public, because in middle school, it's like middle school and high school, and the teachers change like this, like this, I don't know if they change every year, but you still remember that it's name1 teacher and name2 teacher, both of them were mathematics, but that's a step-by-step math class, and the kids both hated it, so I wanted to go to another class, and I didn't want to be in the public, so the kids always did it, so name2 is a little bit of something, a little bit weird, once the character is sorted out, and then the rumors weren't so good, so name1 is funny, funny, but there's a lot of bullies, and there's five basic ones, and the funny thing is, it'd be some kind of an escape route or something that doesn't fit.\ncaller: You know, I don't remember a word of it, but I'm Japanese, and I'm Chinese, and I had a native-language teacher when we were in middle school, and you and I were in Chinese class, and I thought the teacher was good, and then I remembered some words, like Chinese.\nreceiver: At this point, I'm asking you that because that's all I can remember in Chinese, and I have a Chinese name, which is Xiaoqing, and I'm introducing myself, which is Zhaoqing, and the only thing I can remember is this sentence.\ncaller: I can't remember anything except your Chinese name, what are you doing now, and this and that, but it's a little different than Japanese, and I want to learn Chinese well, but my friend says that there are some kids who learn French in high school and just like karate, but it seems like it would be fun to learn that too, but lately, when we were in school, we used to shoot Hadoori cams, and lately, we make videos and learn this and that.\nreceiver: When I was in high school, you know, kids were learning coding these days, and I said, \"Well, I learned something when I was in school, like flash, and I learned something for a little while, and I just learned something during information time, and I suddenly remembered that my high school graduation was weird again, and I wanted to be a high school graduate, and I was like, what's your name?\ncaller: I don't look like that, but when I was in elementary school, I was a pretty elite student, and I was just at that graduation ceremony, and I looked at society, and I would say, \"Goodbye\", and things like that, and I usually study well, and I wear rings, and things like this, and I used to be a vice principal, and I studied well, and so I said goodbye, and I remember wearing a dress at that time.\nreceiver: I don't remember anything in particular, and I'm like, you know, quiet and cool and all that sort of stuff, because now it's kind of a competition, and I never do that sort of thing, and so I go to school, and I just really remember that I have this kind of life fair, and you know, when you go to school you do that, and I really had to write poems too, and poems, and paintings, and walks, and stuff like that, and then I just really didn't want to do any poems at all, and so about ten minutes ago, I remember something I did, and I wrote a poem about, let's see the sky, when there's something sad, or something like that.\ncaller: Oh, I think you're a real language expert. I've never had one. I don't write. I never do that. When I stop writing, I'm like, oh, there's always a trilogy. There's no trilogy.\nreceiver: I've had it all, I've been through elementary school, middle school, high school, and this is what kids are saying these days, that they're a little reluctant to have it all, and that's because in the meantime, if you go on a trip abroad, there's something you're missing, so when you get it, you're a kid who's never been abroad or anything like that before, so I say that getting it all is a little bit of a reluctance, but I liked getting it all because I love the prize, so why didn't you get it?\ncaller: When I was in elementary school, I thought I was Superman, and then I jumped off a roller coaster in the tenth grade, and my legs were sprained, and I took a break for a day or two, and I didn't get it, and then in high school, you remember, I picked up my sweetheart, and I just had this swelling, and I think I did it because I was sick, and in middle school, I ate a lot of stuff, and I got a bowel infection, but I never got it for one reason or another.\nreceiver: You know, I think I worked really hard at school, but I think I did, and I just kind of had this realization that I had to go to school, and if I didn't go to school I wouldn't have anything to do, and, you know, my mom and dad are a little bit effeminate.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It's not much, but after taxes and insurance, I think my net income is about 145,000 yuan per month.\ncaller: But it's not an internship, you can't get a job at your current company, so you have to keep preparing for the job while you're there, and you're spending almost all of the money you've saved up so far, and if you leave the internship you're going to have to put aside the living expenses and the tuition costs necessary to start studying for a full-time job.\ncaller: So I'd like to find a way to save some money and get interest, which is usually a deposit or a deposit, but it's usually a short one-year term.\ncaller: But the risky investments, like stocks and funds, are definitely better than savings, but I'm also not very good at investing, and I'm a little bit nervous about losing all the money I've invested, so I'm just going to let it go, and I think it's better to get as much interest as I can get.\nreceiver: How's the CMA?\ncaller: I've been looking for products and reading the product description and the terms and conditions, and I've found that RP products have a good rate of return, but it's a securities brokerage model, so it doesn't protect depositors, and there's a risk of loss of cash.\ncaller: Of course, they're investing in bonds that are safe and low-risk, but if they don't have the money, it's life-threatening.\nreceiver: Do you have any other conditions?\ncaller: I think the most important thing is the cash collateral, the stability, and I think it's okay to have a deposit or a deposit, but it's not a huge amount to put in, and it's also not a lot of money to hold for a long time, and then the higher the interest rate, the better, and I want the contract to be as short as possible so that I can terminate immediately after the internship.\nreceiver: The shortest period of time is six months.\ncaller: I think it's probably right around the end of your internship, and you're just starting out in your social life, and your consumption patterns are all over the place.\ncaller: Regular savings are burdensome, but what if there's a savings account that allows me to adjust my monthly savings balance or amount depending on my circumstances, rather than the disadvantages of not putting a certain amount in regularly every month?\nreceiver: There's also free will.\ncaller: So let's say I set my monthly savings at $300,000/$300,000, and I sign up for free money, and if I put less than that or I don't put any money in, there's no disadvantages.\ncaller: But here I see that when you do it with a one-year/one-year periodic payment, the interest rate is 2.5 times higher than five times this point. If you collect more, you collect more interest, and even if you have to save 300 thousand yuan / thirty thousand yen each, it's a little bit troubling because the money you can collect is also certain. If you sign a one year/one year contract, will it be difficult to balance?\nreceiver: It is possible.\ncaller: Does \"possible\" mean you can't get the interest, but you can get the principal back?\ncaller: But if you quit your internship and don't get a job right away, it's the first semester of the recruitment process, and you don't have time to write a resume, prepare for exams, prepare for interviews, and you haven't got any money saved up, and if you want to save every month, then you're going to have to go out and find another job, and you're not going to have enough time to do that.\ncaller: And every month I have to travel with my high school classmates, apart from that, and the company where I work as an intern is a bit far from home, so I have to pay daily transportation costs, and there are days when I have to take a taxi every day (3000 yuan) / ((three thousand yuan)) monthly (90000 yuan)) / ((four million yuan)) expenses.\ncaller: And then you lose more than 100,000 won from your salary. Lunch, fortunately, is subsidized by the company, but still, after living expenses, maintenance expenses and all that, there's only 300,000 won left, because there may be a month when you don't have enough.\ncaller: o/ So, six months/six months? Yes, I'll just do that. Do you have to open a new account? I've already created a wallet and I don't use it, so I'm going to use it.\nreceiver: How about 6 months/ 6 months?\ncaller: Yeah, I'll just do that. Do you need to open a new safe deposit box? I've already created a safe deposit box that I don't use, and I think it's a good idea to switch accounts with it.\nreceiver: Uh, that's difficult.\ncaller: So I can't help but wonder if it's okay for me to create a new savings account and then get rid of the safe deposit box in my name? Until a few years ago, it was a trend that it was difficult to create an account, and if you just kept it, it might be useful someday, so I didn't get rid of it.\ncaller: It's hard to keep track of all the ones you have, because you don't want to leave out the ones you don' t use, and they don' t come in.\nreceiver: Please call us with your full name and social security number.\ncaller: Yes, that's right, this is 9712122.\nreceiver: You have 31 yuan in your account, can I transfer it?\ncaller: Later, when you open a savings account, transfer it there, and if there's a transfer fee, just take it to the bank.\ncaller: And if it's $30,000 per month for six months, is it possible to withdraw the rest of the money if you fill in the middle and save more than that?\nreceiver: (2 times) / (this round) is good.\ncaller: A/ Yes, what is the procedure for signing up? Can I do it over the phone or do I have to do it in person after the call ends?\nreceiver: Uh, go to our website right now and apply for a new savings account.\ncaller: Yeah, wait a minute. You just press apply, and you have to do one of these two things -- validation certificate and iPin certification?\ncaller: I've verified it, and I've put my name in there, and my social security number, and the rest of my cell phone number, and my e-mail, and my address, and at the end of it, I'm checking my marketing inbox to see if I'm getting e-mails, or whether I'm receiving text messages.\nreceiver: It's both.\ncaller: Now, if I agree to this, and it turns out that we're doing an event with Trump Financial Securities for our regular, loose-leaf subscribers under $300,000/$300,000/month to convert them to a 5%/$500/month interest-bearing product, does that include me?\ncaller: But the condition is that you have to issue a W card and fill in the balance sheet, and then it's going to be harder for you to spend more money and save more money, so I'm just going to check your consent to receive information in an email and not participate in that event.\ncaller: If it says the application is complete, does that mean my work is done?\nreceiver: Yes, you can set up an account.\ncaller: Yes, ah/ Now I don't see the deposit account, it's in the deposit you just made. Ah/ I forgot something important, when is the monthly withdrawal?\nreceiver: It's the 14th day.\ncaller: So this month is over, what do we do? It's too late to start next month, and now (31 yuan) / (thirty one yuan) has been deposited, so the deposit has been opened? So this month (300000 yuan) / ((thirty million yuan) can just be put in.\ncaller: Thank you. I'll have to move it today. After 6 months/ 6 months, I'll need to be consulted here if I want to withdraw my savings and invest it again.\nreceiver: Thank you.

Because we were seized from an illegal site, the two accounts themselves were processed simultaneously with synchronized processing and reimbursement to the National Depository. First of all, have you ever visited the iron ore mine last July and opened a financial transaction?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: You don't have any notes?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, when we looked at the two accounts we mentioned and submitted them to the Financial Supervisory Authority, it was definitely confirmed that they were opened in your name, in your name. This is a large-scale financial fraud case involving not only you, but more than 180 people nationwide. So we are in consultation with the Financial Supervisor and we are in the process of investigating, and the exact reason why we contacted Mr. Mistoung is that you opened the account yourself and sold the ATM and surrendered it to the Kim Jong-il Party for monetary compensation, or that your personal information was leaked, but the person who used your name contacted us to ask about the identity of the victim.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I don't think you knew anything about what I said, and you didn't know anything about the opening of the ATM. First of all, it wasn't just a case of two ATMs being found that led to the call. In fact, it was your ATM that led to an illegal transfer of funds. You were transferred to our Advanced Crime Investigation Team because the victims made deposits and the damage was caused.\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Are you on duty? I can't reach you. I've contacted you for an enquiry, and if you can't, we'll give you a brief explanation.\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: You don't know anything about the Neighborhood Café, where you buy and sell second-hand goods?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The first one is similar to the Internet shopping mall site where the goods are being sold. On this side, it says that Kim Jong-il's supporters are selling high-priced handicrafts or electronics at a low price, and the supporters have deposited the money in the account of the Agricultural Cooperation and Development Bank in his name. So now only the amount has been collected and the money has been frozen. We have not sent the goods to the buyers.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Since there is no single charge in the case of Mr. Misunderstanding, the recording process is possible and you will be adopted as the only remaining evidence file when you are in court.

Hello?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The most obvious way to do this in four days is the forced redemption process, which is not something that our national bank can handle arbitrarily, but we're now a government-backed product, so we have the authority to ask for cooperation from the banking association, the top banking body, which manages the credit information of our customers.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And if you ask for help, I'm going to help you take advantage of what's called a forced redemption, which is not a credit rating boost, but it's actually a loan that you can't take out if you've gotten it wrong or if there's a problem with the terms of the contract.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, if you make a claim to the bank, even if it's been a while, you'll be able to get it processed without any interest or chargeback fees, without any credit loss to the customer.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: What you're going to have to do now, after applying this method, is we'll help you get a new loan from the fastest financial institution that you can get, so that you don't have to take the loan and use it, but on the same day, we'll ask you to cooperate with the American Bankers Association to get a compulsory redemption authorization.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Once this part of the forced redemption approval is dropped, your client will be assigned a one-on-one dispatch representative, and through this representative you can now know about forced redemptions, and what's important for your client is that, as I mentioned earlier, if you want to raise your credit rating, you have to have a history of using the loan normally.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then when you go into the reimbursement process, you're going to do the billing and so on, and you'll do the credit billing for your customer, and then you'll be able to do the paperwork, and then the billing for the customer, using all of the time that you normally contract for, and making the paperwork as if you've paid all of the bills every month, and doing the work on your customer's bill.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then when you're done, you'll have a normal credit history, and we'll confirm that your credit score is going up, and then you'll ask us to verify that your credit rating is going up because we're going to help you with the overall process.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So as soon as the appraisal department confirms that the credit rating is going up, they're going to issue a guarantee and pay the loan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, if you've understood all of this, I'm going to ask the person in charge to help you with the overall process, and then I'll tell you all of the instructions.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, if you have a client who's a practicing physician, that's what I'm going to do.\nreceiver: It didn't work out so well at the end, what was that?\ncaller: I don't know if it's a speakerphone you're talking about.\nreceiver: Yes, hi. How are you?\ncaller: Please say yes.\nreceiver: Yeah, I don't get it a little bit after the middle.\ncaller: I don't want to go into too much detail, but do you understand what deportation is?\nreceiver: No, I didn't quite get that one.\ncaller: So what exactly is a forced redemption, if this is just an example, if we took a loan from the National Bank, but now it's 4.8% on our side at 44 million won, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And you're not going to get a loan if you're going to contract for the term of the contract, or if you are going to pay interest on the principal, or you're only paying interest.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But when you get a loan, and you get a contract, and you see that the interest rate, or the term of the loan, or the repayment method, is different from what you set up, and you think it's a problem, and you ask us to change it, and you say, \"Well, we've done it our way, so it doesn't matter.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you do that, you can file a claim with the Banking Association, and they'll tell you to fix it because it's wrong, and if you ask them to fix it, they're not going to verify it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then after that fact check, if the financial institution is wrong, if the National Bank is wrong, and if our bank is wrong, then you know that we got this loan from the Banking Association in the form of a forced redemption for our client's loan to us, and it took three or four days, and you know that when you get the interest or the redemption fee or your client gets the loan, your credit rating temporarily goes down or something like that.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If your client returns only the loaned portion, the National Bank is forced to do so by the Banking Union, because it's the supreme body of the bank, and if you get a message from the Banking Association asking you to do this, you're forced to do it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, that's the way it's handled. It's forced redemption. Okay, first of all, this isn't about using forced redemptions to boost your grades, it's about enabling you to do forced redundancy on the same day.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, and now you've told us that you've helped us get loans from other places, and then you've said that the day after you got a loan from them, we've authorized the forced redemption of that loan to the banking association, and now we've made a request for cooperation.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: That's when the agent is assigned by the banking union to enforce the customer's repayment.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then, through that agent, you can force the loan to be repaid now, and you don't have to have a history of using the loan normally when you go into reimbursement.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If it's just a forced redemption, you've taken a loan and you've paid it back.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Because then it doesn't make sense to ask for work on that part, and now you're going to have a two- or three-year contract to get a new loan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then you're going to make all the regular monthly payments for the entire term of the contract, and you're just going to put all the paperwork together so that it looks like you're doing all the normal work on your credit report, and when it's done, it's going to leave a record of how you've used your loan in the past, and we'll be able to verify that if you go through your credit report again, your credit score will go up, and that's where we'll issue a guarantee and pay off the loan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah. Is there something you still don't understand?\nreceiver: No, not at all.\ncaller: Now, if you'd like to proceed, I'll ask the team leader to download this part and help you with the overall process so that you can proceed comfortably.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Can I do that?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, I know, it's a little bit of a hassle, but if you don't have a good credit rating right now, you're not going to be able to get a million or two million dollars out of a loan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you don't get a guarantee, you're getting a government-subsidized loan, and that's why we don't have the authority to disburse it. Even if this part is a bit cumbersome, you can take care of your customer and raise your rating and then call the CEO again.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is there anything else you'd like to know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: Thank you.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

I think it's a good thing that the Olympics are in our country and advertise it through TV and all the media and we can't even go to those places, there are too many people who can't step on the Olympic Stadium, so there is a lot of life for each of us, but because of the difficulty of transportation or access, we can solve such problems, or we can not solve them by ourselves, because there are not many people like that, except for me.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

manage.\ncaller: The maximum amount you can put in a year is $200,000,000, and you can deposit up to $100,000,000 over five years, so the term of the subscription is five years.\ncaller: So you're free to deposit until maturity, but there's a limit to how much you can deposit.\ncaller: You can sign up for three years, five years, two years, and you can invest in two ways.\ncaller: There's the investor-operated model, where the subscriber specifies the products that they put into their ISA account, and then there's the one-time ISA, where you work for the operator and you manage the investments.\ncaller: If you have deposits and funds in an ISA account, and the deposits are interest-bearing assets, but the funds are investment assets that can be profitable, depending on the operational performance, and there's a risk of loss.\ncaller: I'm wondering how you calculate the maturity if the fund's principal loss is a final minus over the interest on the deposit at maturity.\ncaller: But because it's an investment product, there's a high risk of losing money, but the funds that you can use as an ISA are very limited to bonds or mixed products, so that's what I'm saying.\ncaller: So even if there's a loss at maturity, you can offset it to some extent.\ncaller: On the other hand, if you have a good liquidity at maturity and you're making a lot of profits on a fund product, you're taxed on the excess profits.\ncaller: I don't know if you said excise or withholding tax.\ncaller: You can get a tax credit of up to 200,000 yuan on your net profit, and the rest of your profits are taxed at a lower rate.\ncaller: So let's say that at maturity, if you have $100,000,000 in cash, and the net profit on $100,000,000 is $400, then you don't tax $200, but you tax the other $200 at a lower rate.\ncaller: In the case of a one-time ISA, my views are not reflected at all in the way the investment is handled, and I'm a little nervous about taking the product myself, so I'm trying to join a one time ISA.\ncaller: And that makes me wonder if my opinion isn't reflected at all, or if it isn't.\ncaller: Oh, so you set up a portfolio in advance, and after analyzing the investor's preferences, you give them some suggestions for a portfolio to analyze, and then the investor ultimately chooses and operates it.\ncaller: I didn't know how to manage my investments, and I mistakenly thought it was a way to get my money back at the end of the term.\ncaller: I think it's a good idea to go with a one-time ISA, but I talked to a financial institution and they said only one-to-one accounts are available, so the availability of funds varies from financial institution to financial institution.\ncaller: It depends on where you sign up, what's the availability of the shares?\ncaller: If you go to the Sharing Securities website, you can see the product-by-product availability, and then after you sign up, you can use the Availability Reporting Application Service to get it individually.\ncaller: There are so many different products invested in an ISA account, and I'm wondering how the deposit protection system applies to them, whether they're all separated by product, whether the ISA account itself is subject to deposit protection.\ncaller: So in an ISA account, we're going to apply a deposit protection system to each investment product, and for deposits, which are deposit protection products, you can have up to $50,000,000 in principal plus interest, and investment products like mutual funds and derivatives are excluded because they're not protected.\ncaller: The ISA account is an ISA account that only employee-owners can apply for.\ncaller: I'm an employee, so it's possible to sign up, but as I said before, I only have a one-to-one account through a financial institution, so that's the only part that matters.\ncaller: If you're a pensioner or a fisherman, you can sign up, and my father is a pensioner, and I think we should ask the ISA and encourage them to sign up, because these days savings aren't worth investing in, and it's nice to be able to mix deposits and investment products properly.\ncaller: Now, since the products that you put in the ISA can vary depending on your situation, you can rebalance them on a yearly basis, and you can do that with an expert every year, and then you can do the rebalancing appropriately, and you'll be able to manage your return.\ncaller: You can sign up for an ISA on the Sharing Securities website or in the mobile app, but a one-time ISA is only available at the point of sale.\ncaller: I've been around ISA a lot lately, and I was so curious about what the product was, that I understood it perfectly.\ncaller: Thank you so much for your detailed explanation.\nreceiver: Do you have any other questions?\ncaller: It doesn't.\nreceiver: Thank you.

How are you?\nreceiver: What can I do for you?\ncaller: I'd like to apply for a loan.\nreceiver: Yes, there are products that you can borrow for free.\ncaller: Is there a difference between the Darrin Faster Loan and the Darrin OneClick Loan?\ncaller: I've been thinking about those two products, and the faster loan is good because the final interest rate is lower than OneClick, but this one has a mid-term repayment fee, and OneClick has a slightly higher base rate.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is it correct to calculate the final interest rate at 0.8% of the base rate minus the coupon rate at 2.28% per annum?\ncaller: But these products don't have a premium. They don't come with a discount. It's frustrating.\nreceiver: Yeah, because it's a horror commodity.\ncaller: Are the interest rates on these products fixed or variable? There's also a mixed rate, which seems to be a mixture of fixed and variable.\nreceiver: It's a floating rate.\ncaller: So if the benchmark rate changes over the life of the loan, does that change my loan rate?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is there going to be a change in the benchmark, or is it going to be because the economy is not doing so well?\nreceiver: You don't know that.\ncaller: I love that there's a mid-term repayment fee, because you have to take out a loan secretly, so you have to pay it off as soon as you get the money.\ncaller: Suddenly, my best friend asked me to lend him some business capital, and soon the money was coming in, and if I didn't close the other card now, I would be broke, so he said to me to borrow the money urgently, that I would pay it back as soon as the money came in. I couldn't refuse to lend him the money because I was so desperate, so I needed an emergency.\ncaller: Can you subtract the interim repayment fee, which is the ratio of the interim reimbursement fee to the interest rate over the remaining life of the loan, and if the interest rate is 1.8 percent, it's way above the base rate.\ncaller: So it seems to me that one-click loans have a lower interest rate, assuming they pay off quickly, because there's a lot of loans out there, and it's hard for me to find the right one.\nreceiver: So let me introduce you to a quick loan with a similar interest rate and a faster loan with no interchange fees.\ncaller: Is there such a product? It's great if there is, and if there are no intermediate repayment fees, and if the interest rates are similar to faster loans, then I'll definitely sign up for that product, but there will be conditions.\nreceiver: Yes, there's some paperwork you need to submit for that item.\ncaller: Yes, may I submit something?\nreceiver: Are you on duty?\ncaller: Yeah, I've been with the company for about five years now, and since I'm on maternity leave, the approximate duration is four years, and I have four insurance policies, and I'm paying a lot of taxes, and my salary is about three million rupees a month.\nreceiver: If you are a salaried worker, you must provide proof of employment and proof of income issued by the Finnish Tax Agency.\ncaller: Is it possible to sign up for this as well? I don't have time to go to the bank, because there are no DDRIM branches near my company.\ncaller: And when I get home from work, the bank is closed, and if I'm not too far from the bank, I tell my boss that I'm going to leave work a little bit early, because I'm in the next neighborhood, and I don't have a car, so I have to take public transportation, and then I have to leave work an hour early, because it's too conspicuous.\nreceiver: Yes, you can with an open door.\ncaller: And I'm very happy about that, and I'm a little worried because I've never taken out a loan online, but I think it's all right with the websites these days.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So I'm going to download some documents and apply for a loan online.\ncaller: Counsellor, do you have any deposits or collateral in the Dardim Bank?\nreceiver: Yes, there is.\ncaller: I have a savings account in a DDRIM bank, and there's about five million yuan in there, and can I borrow it as collateral? Because collateral loans have lower interest rates.\nreceiver: Please state your name and social security number.\ncaller: His name is Yinghai, and his social security number is 111111 2222222.\nreceiver: Yes, the deposit account you signed up for is a collateralized account.\ncaller: How much of your down payment can you borrow? I think it would be a big help if you could borrow half of it, because I know that's a low interest rate.\nreceiver: It's within 100 percent of what you pay.\ncaller: So I'd like to get a loan with a deposit collateral instead of a quick loan product.\nreceiver: Yes, you can borrow it online, and you have to have a mobile phone certificate in your name.\ncaller: Yes, I will do that.\nreceiver: Do you have any more questions?\ncaller: I don't want him to know that I'm lending him money, because he doesn't like our friendship, and when we first got married, my mother made him take out a medical certificate, and it made him feel bad.\ncaller: But the first person to talk about it was my brother, and he's got a really bad feeling about him, and if he finds out that you loaned him money, he's going to be really mad.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: You don't know the groom? It's a big deal. I can't even imagine what happens if you fall for him.\nreceiver: Does your spouse have a valid ID of your client?\ncaller: It's stored on my home computer, but I don't really care about it, and I put it in a public computer at the beginning of the wedding, and I offered to put it in, but we don't care about each other, and I'm annoyed by the groom's personality, so I don' t think I need to check it with my certificate.\nreceiver: If you don't verify it with a valid certificate, your loan information will not be contacted separately by your spouse.\ncaller: I'm so glad, I'll have to erase the credentials at home, but if I do it suddenly, it'll be suspicious, but I don't know, because my desktop doesn't work well, and I'm afraid my friend will have to pay me back soon.\ncaller: I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

They report it, or there's too many transactions in the ledger, so this is it.

This is it. I've tried to violate the foreign exchange control laws before, and now I've been fined.

I have two accounts in the People's Bank of China, please let me withdraw to one of them.\ncaller: I was about to make a separate deposit, but if I don't make a deposit, does it automatically cancel the deposit?\nreceiver: You can deposit it next month.\ncaller: Fortunately, other banks can be dissolved if they don't make a deposit, but the People's Bank seems to think more from the customer's point of view, so that's great.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.\ncaller: And then after three years, what's the total revenue?

I think from that point of view, we should first of all make some policy, first of all, because it seems to me that something is going in the opposite direction.\nreceiver: Well, I know that there are a lot of reasons why refugees come to our country in the first place, but for me, I don't know exactly why they came to our country, but I think they have their own legitimate reasons, and it's not just because they like Korea, or because there's something wrong with them, and they think that they came to this country because they had to, and I think it would be very helpful for me personally if I told you that if there were such refugees among my acquaintances, then you would say, well, when the refugees come into our country, they have these kinds of jobs that we Koreans don't like, and if you give those jobs to the refugees, our people would like them too, and they can get jobs as well.\ncaller: In fact, it's a good thing that you're offering jobs to refugees, but the problem is that the business owners are making these refugees, who don't know anything, work like slaves, and they're paying their salaries. In fact, there are a lot of people in our country who are doing this kind of work and getting paid for it, especially those who are employed in the printing industry, and there's a lot of parts to it, and the fact that these jobs are being offered to refugees all day long, whether they're good or bad, I'm not sure, but if you're going to give them jobs, I'd love to hear that voice, because I think that's a great example of the lack of voice workers in our country.\nreceiver: Well, I don't think I'm going to buy it, because personally, I'm not one of those people who buys books and reads them, but if it's a bestseller and people are looking for it, then I think for some reason, I'll go to the library and borrow a book and read it, and name one, I think there's a role for the state and a role for individuals in these local refugee issues, but have you ever thought about what the role of this individual is?\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

So if you think about why Japan's perception of Korea is like this, well, Korea in the '70s was partly an authoritarian country, partly a military dictatorship, and partly a colonial city that had pledged allegiance to Japan, so when I saw it, I thought that Japan hasn't seen China or any of these places very easily for a long time, and this is something that we've had a lot of clashes with since last year, because of export controls.\nreceiver: If you're a Korean citizen, it seems that you have the feeling that even if you're not an active classmate or that it's not right, you don't support it. I haven't actively come out in the open, but I've been writing articles and looking at the various actions of those Japanese people, and it seems that this isn't really going in the wrong direction. I've had a lot of thoughts like that, so I think that in the future we should get out of the idea that Japan is a bit stuck, but maybe there's no chance of recovery.\ncaller: Well, Japan seems to have a bit of a fixed stereotype that Korea is ambiguous, especially since the Abe regime has some control over the media, and it seems to be even more so, so instead of trying to face reality, they change their coverage of Korea in subtle ways to suit the public's tastes, and even the coronavirus countermeasures are reported that Japan is good at reporting, and instead there is a lot of talk about Korea being more ambiguous and so on.\nreceiver: I don't think it's just a temporary problem, but it's been happening constantly from the past to the present, and in the meantime, it's continuing to show up in a way that some events amplify it and make it more noticeable, and so we're paying attention to these things for a while when it gets a little bit bigger and bigger, and then we're not paying attention when it doesn't, and then it happens again and again, and it just keeps happening over and over and over again, and there seems to be no fundamental solution, and so I think we need to approach it more rationally and with some sort of smarter system of care, rather than just focusing on the emotional part of it and dealing with it emotionally.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

So did he ask for money?\nreceiver: Yeah, first they asked me about my grades and admissions, and then all of a sudden they said they needed admission processing fees, so I said, \"How much?\" and they said, \"About three million dollars\".\ncaller: Yeah, and then what?\nreceiver: So I asked him how to send the money, and he told me to transfer it to a specific account, and he gave me the account number, and I wrote it down in case I didn't know.\ncaller: What about the account number?\nreceiver: Yes, the account number is 123-4567-8901-23.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.

Voice-spying is very subtle, so you always have to be careful. So, Mr. Imigatsu, can you help us get the police department to investigate this case further?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.

It's good to distribute because it's free to use, and it works when it's short-term, but if it's prolonged, then in the real world, the country, the country will be inefficient, and each individual will be worried.\ncaller: But whatever we're talking about right now, I think we're headed for a corona epidemic, and it's so big right now, and I think about this president, and I can't think of anything but corona, and the fact is, how he's been confirmed, he's responsible for his own position, he has to be accountable to the whole country and the people, and the president who's going to do this kind of impulsive behavior, and this guy's nickname is the Trump of Brazil, and I don't know what his preferences are.\nreceiver: He's also a character that he basically has, and he doesn't change that easily, so to say something like that, you know, he wouldn't have had a spokesperson or anyone around him telling him to say that, but what he said was that in the old days, if you had a gay son, you wouldn't be able to love him, and it would be better to just let him die in a car accident.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

This is my favorite and I'm trying to eat it the way I usually do. It's rice instead of flour, but it's a personal thing, but it suits my body better and it's good for digestion, so I try to eat mostly rice and vegetable stew.\ncaller: I don't usually make a big deal out of breakfast, but these days I just eat a simple cereal or a banana or a milkshake, because when I wake up in the morning, I'm not really hungry, so instead of making a big deal of breakfast, I just make a simple deal of breakfast.\nreceiver: I'm a big fan of mushrooms, because they're stuffed with spices, and then you can put all these different types of dried mushrooms in them and eat them, so you can actually put them in a bowl, but they're also really nutritious, and you can feel them, so I'm really into mushrooms.\ncaller: Well, I'm a frequent visitor, so I don't go to a lot of restaurants, but there's a restaurant that I go to once or twice a year, and now there's this place called Kaljebi, which is a combination of carrot juice and artichokes, and it's a food that only a few locals know about, so other outsiders don't know much about it, so it's very nutritious and delicious, but I go to it a couple of times a year.\nreceiver: I'm a big fan of variety, and I think you'll find that when it's hot like these days, there's a lot of things in Japanese food that can be eaten a little bit cold, and especially that kind of thing, like cold noodles, or chowder soup, because it's cold, and I like to eat it cool in the summer, so in the summer I often go to a fast food restaurant.\ncaller: I'm not a seasonal foodie, but I don't eat anything cool in the summer, and I like to eat something a little bit hot and a little bit salty because of the heat, so I'd rather have the ice cream you mentioned earlier, or the stew, or something like that in the summer than something cold or something like this.\nreceiver: Speaking of fast-food restaurants, I'd like to recommend a fast-food restaurant that I've just been to. It's called a herbal stew, and it's near the central train station. Well, actually, it's very simple, and it serves menus that are quite cheap, but there's quite a lot of food, and I think it's more delicious than the original menu.\ncaller: I'm sorry, but I haven't been to many different countries lately, so I don't really know a lot about different restaurants, and I eat mostly all kinds of food, of course, but now that I've eaten so much of the popular one-meal-one-meal diet, I think I can recommend a lot.\nreceiver: I don't know about the variety, but it's a little bit strange, you might think it's strange, but I know about the Mongolian restaurant, because I've been in Mongolia, and I'm in Korea, and I wanted to eat Mongolian food, so I looked for it, and there was one in Daegu on the Bible side, and there's also a restaurant where the Mongolian people were doing a lot of fishing, and you can eat Mongolian cuisine, so we use a lot of flour and meat in Mongolian traditional cuisine, and the traditional cuisine. So if you go there, you can eat that fried almond-like dish called khoshor, and then you can eat cotton and meat and vegetables, and then there's the king food called khoshore, and there are a lot of Mongolian restaurants, so you milk the fish from the cattle, and you drink the milk like that, and you boil the milk with it, and you also drink the milk from the fish, and there you can have a special meal, in case you remember that.\ncaller: I think it was Vietnamese food, actually, but I've had it before, and I can't remember the name of it, and I've put some salt and pepper on it, and then I've made it like a casserole, and I put some weird stuff in it and I don't really remember the ingredients, and actually, that's how I just made it and sold it, and it was wrapped, but it was a little spicy, and I remember it tasted kind of peculiar, so I still remember it, but I know where I got it from, but I can not remember the menu, so I'm not sure if you're a good cook.\nreceiver: Well, I'm usually the kind of person who tries to make sure that I eat all my food, so I do a lot of cooking myself, so I usually try to keep one or two dinners in the fridge, and I don't try a lot of different dishes, so if I'm making a curry, for example, I usually put this much potato or carrot and onion in it, but if I only put this much, I'll put some tomatoes in it, and then I'll slice them both up and try to eat them, and that's how I change the ingredients in the food that I'm eating, and I try a lot.\ncaller: I used to try to eat three slices a day, but now that I wake up late in the morning, I often don't eat breakfast well, and I often eat a little bit simpler, but I try to eat it well for lunch and dinner, and now, especially in the evening, I like to have one sliced slice at home and eat it well. You said before that you like slices, so if you have sliced head slices of sliced peas, which of the three do you like best?\nreceiver: I love all of them, but I'm most attracted to the gingerbread dumplings, because they're kind of macadamia nuts, and they're also kind of kimchi nuts, but they have a little bit of sweetness, and it's kind of sour when you're making the ginger bread dumpling, and there's two of them in there, so you can taste a little bit soft at the same time, so it tastes sharp, and the ingredients are soft, so you get a little bit more of a variety of sensations at once, so I think I like that. Well, you work out a lot, but when you work out, it seems like you care a lot about your diet, too.\ncaller: Now, I don't work as hard as an athlete, and I didn't do that on my own, and in the past, when I was trying to lose some weight, of course, I was on a high-protein diet, but now I'm eating so much salad and chicken nuggets and tomato paste, and it's a little bit less calorie, and it gives me a lot of vitamins and proteins that my body needs, and I think it's very tasty, but I remember eating it.\nreceiver: No, I don't like to count nutrients or calories or anything like that specifically, or eat them carefully, but I like to make food that I want to eat that day, that I like to eat, or that I can use the ingredients that are left in the fridge to make food. Well, I'm not following that strictly, but still, as much as possible, I like to try to avoid those instant foods or retro foods that are a little too easy to cook, that have a lot of spices in them, or that have some kind of preservatives in them.\ncaller: I used to eat a lot of jellybeans, jelly water, jelly, and then there's energy, and there's a lot of different kinds of jelly beans and spices, and it makes me feel fuller than I thought it would be, but now there's jellybean jelly, so it's low in calories, and it doesn't matter if you eat a lot, so I guess I used to take a lot of it at night when I was hungry, and of course now I don't care, so I just have vegetables at night, and then I have chicken, and I have pizza, and I think maybe if you're thinking about it, maybe you should eat that.\nreceiver: Well, I'm not the best at it, but there's one that I do a lot of, and it's a food that makes you feel a little bit full, a little bit overwhelmed, and I like to do it a little bit more often, and that's the kind of food that you can make if you have eggs and beef and onions, and you just make the sauce and then you put the rest of the ingredients on top of it, and it is simple, but it's also a dish that you can serve a little bit, so it's something that you do a lot when you have people over, and, well, if you have guests over at your house, what kind of food do you usually serve or do you deliver?\ncaller: Well, I usually do a lot of deliveries when my friends come home, but when I make the food myself, I think I've made a little bit more of a curry now that I'm making curry, and I like curry again, so I think I made a little more curry, because I could use this curry for a lot of different things, and I could just bake it and eat it as a curry, but now I make it with cotton, and then I make it in chunks, or like breadcrumbs, and it tastes good, so I guess I made a lot of curry and gave it to them, and I guess the lobster didn't crack so much, so I always made it tasty and ate it, and then you said you like lobster curry, so you're very interested in that.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I'll be honest with you, I'm still very lonely, and I don't know how lonely I'm going to be living abroad. So I'm trying to figure out how to do it.\ncaller: I'm currently studying English literature and so I'm studying English culture and literature and all kinds of practical English, but it's just the beginning of the school year, so it's actually a little bit different, I'm just going to school, and in fact, these days, not all schools are face-to-face, they're online, so it looks like it's quite comfortable, I just go light-heartedly, but then it's the end of the academic year, so now I'm in a position where I have to graduate from English here and actually go into the business side, and I think that's the hardest thing in my academic life, doing something in fashion.\nreceiver: The hardest thing about fashion is that I have to think about design, especially when I'm thinking about something that I want to finish and finish school and go home and relax, but it doesn't end, and I have to keep thinking about design at home, and, you know, when I want to do this design and finish my sketches, the walls of reality collide so much more than I thought, because it's not following the principle, and, for example, when I think like this, when I try to think of designing like this, I can't re-do it, or it's a design that doesn't make sense, and the professor says, \"I can't do it, so I'm doing something about design\", and it's really hard not to be able to do what I thought I could do, but I'm wondering if this isn't a dream, but it's something I want to achieve in life.\ncaller: I've been thinking about this a lot, and dreams are actually professional goals, and there's no end to that, so I want to live a life through that professional goal, and what kind of person I want to be, and this is something that one should think about for a lifetime, but it's not a dream, it's just a living, and the goal is to have something that I can afford to take care of my people, a life that I can pursue, or something that moves me, not something that I think and feel, something that I realize, something that express, a little bit freely, not too much order, but something I can do in that proper order, which is a large yard, for example, a large house without a yard, where you can plant flowers, you can have a dog, you can play in it, but if you want to do that, you can basically do something material, or you can live a little more leisurely, and then you have a garden, and you have a life, and if that's the goal, then you have to live a little bit more leisure, like a home, and if you have that kind of\nreceiver: As I said before, I've spent a lot of my life being dragged around by people, and I don't want to get married, or be tied down by anyone, so I'm looking for my happiness, my happiness is the most important thing in my life, and that's one of my biggest goals in life, and so I know that money shouldn't be chasing money, but I think that's the way it should be, because that's where my happiness is, and then I'm going to save some money, and I want to go on a trip, or I want to travel around the world, I want to do everything, and I also want to serve, and I really want to raise a puppy, and I've heard that organic dogs, honestly, are harder to raise than just being bred in a pet shop, because they're artificial, and they're sick, and there's so many things to take care of, and so the thing that's costing me the most money is that they look small, but they cost the most money, so my goal is to make the most money.\ncaller: Obviously, money is very important, and that's why people don't just want to make a lot of money, but they have to earn a certain amount of money in order to enjoy a free life, so I think that money should be moderate, but I think that if you make a lot, there's a lot you can do, because human greed has no end.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

If you press on it, you'll see the section you're reporting, the profile section, the contact section, and so on.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'm gonna need you to get in touch with the Holy Ship.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Yes, and if you're a customer and you need the money, you'll have to give me one cent for the 98 million won that you've received.\ncaller: Ah, the 9800.\nreceiver: Yes, 9800, and you don't have to enter the interest part either, but the interest, please remember, is 7.3%, okay?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Yeah, hold on a second.\ncaller: Do you have to write something like this?\nreceiver: No, no, that part is now vacant, and I've got all the records now, so I need you to enter your name, contact information, and three entries for the amount of money you need, and in the case of the application, a replacement loan.\ncaller: A repayment loan.\nreceiver: Four repayment loans.\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: Yes, then, uh, wait a minute, please press once to receive the application.\ncaller: Apply now.\nreceiver: So you've got your receipt, and if you've done that, you've received your application from us, and now during the day, when you're going to get your loan funds, you'll probably get an e-signature from the appraisal department, and they'll ask you to run our application, and then you'll see an e-sign box, and you'll run the part of the application that you just installed, and it'll say, well, if you just e-sign it, once you're out of the loan funds in the day, please let the customer know about that situation, and we'll continue at 7.3 percent with no fundamental changes.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: And then you see, wait a minute, if you have a way to pay your interest on the principal, and you have a five-year, sixty-month payment method, would you prefer to make your monthly payments on the principal equal to the interest?\ncaller: I'm just going to take this one as a trade-off.\nreceiver: Well, you can set it up for two to three years, two years, three years, but first of all, how many years is the initial setup?\ncaller: Let's make the initial setup three years.\nreceiver: Yes, we're going to do it for three years, and from now on, if you're a customer, you can change it in two years, and after two years, if you call us and say that you would like to be reimbursed now in the form of an equal refund of the principal, because we can process it that way, you can call us at any time and make the payment of the principal.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: And if you do, I'm going to send a note to Sanwamani right now and have him pick up the call that I made. Sanwamani, when you receive your loan, would you like to take this $18 million from your client's office?

Are you 032-291-9489?\ncaller: Yeah, that sounds about right.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'll put a call through here, and you'll get a call back as soon as I've processed the partial approval for the paperwork.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: The first time you took out a loan on the Sun and Moon side, you didn't get any refunds at all?\ncaller: No, there's no reimbursement fee for this.\nreceiver: How long have you been using it?\ncaller: It's been six months.\nreceiver: Well, it's been about six months.\ncaller: If you're a customer, I'll call you as soon as I've sent you the paperwork and you've cleared it, and I'm sure you'll be able to process the refunds today, right?\ncaller: Yes, yes, I'll do it for you today.\nreceiver: Yes, I understand. If so, I'll send you an official letter, and as soon as it's approved, we'll be in touch.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

I usually say that it's cooler, but I like it better because it's shorter than winter, or maybe it's a little bit sad, but I miss it a lot, because these days autumn is shorter, but I think it's even shorter than late autumn.\ncaller: Well, I always get excited when it's spring, so I always want to run outside, and when I look out of the window and see all the leaves, it's nice, and it's cold, and then it's warm, and when you go out again, you feel better, and your clothes are thinner, and you want to go out a little bit, so I'm a little bit more of a spring person, so I think it's a little bit better to feel a little bit of spring than it is in winter, if you have good memories about the weather.\nreceiver: It's probably the best season to be elected because the weather is warmer than it is hot, and I think I like it better when it's autumn or winter than summer, and in the fall, a few years ago, I was at my father's funeral, and I remember where I was at that time, where I was with my family in the fall and I remember that it was a good time, and if you're going to date, which of the four seasons would be the best?\ncaller: Uh, I think winter is the best time to date, because you're in love, so you can hang out, and you can do lots of fun things at home without going out, and I think other seasons are good, but winter is also good for holding hands, and being closer together, so it's the best time for dating.\nreceiver: There are four seasons in our country, but if there could only be one season, I'd prefer it to be a country with one season of winter rather than autumn, so I don't like a country where the summer continues, and when I travel, I think I've never had a bad memory of Southeast Asia.\ncaller: The weather in Jeju really changes so much from day to day that even the weather forecast doesn't seem to be right, but it's nice to have a lot of wind, and it's cool and warm, and Jeju's weather is really Taiwanese. I hated the wind at first, but now if there's no wind, it's a little foggy and it won't snow, but if you go to the Hanlan Mountains and there's a lot of snow, when you see all these things, the weather is not right in Jeju, but I like the snow, the wind is good, the sun is hot, and I'm satisfied with the weather in which season I was born in Jeju.\nreceiver: I was born in the summer, and to be honest, my birthday is coming up, and I've heard people say that people who are born in summer spend more time in summer, and I sweat a lot, and it's hard for me to spend time in summer. I don't know if that's true, but I think it's true for me that people who were born in summer have more time in the summer.\ncaller: I've traveled to a lot of countries where it's a little bit warmer, whether it's winter or summer, and I've also traveled a lot to Southeast Asia, which is a country with four seasons, and I traveled there a lot during the summer of that country, and when I travel to that country in the summer, I feel like I'm carrying a little less baggage, and I think it would be better to wear clothes that are a little bit lighter, because it's hot, rather than going out and being too cold.\nreceiver: I don't go to the water so much, and kids are getting older, and they don't really want to go there, but I can't think of a lot of advantages of summer, because in summer, you can still have cool clothes, shoes, and bags, and they're lighter, and you feel a little lighter and cooler than in winter.\ncaller: No, it's good to have a warm wind, but it's also too strong, so you're not going to be able to feel it, so I'd like you to give it a little bit of air, and then it's cold for a few days, and then yesterday it's too hot again, so you can't adapt, and then slowly it warms up, and slowly it cools down, and then I would like you to do this, but then suddenly it gets cold, and then suddenly it's hot, and the wind isn't right, and it's not strong, and so you won't be able to adapt, but I don't like the weather in Jeju, and I like everything else in Jeju because the weather feels pretty good, so even if the wind is warm, I think it's better to let it blow just right, because there's some wind when you go to the ocean and play in the water, and that's better.\nreceiver: I remember going on a trip with my family a few years ago, and we went abroad, and the weather was autumn, and it was summer, but not autumn, because it was like autumn. We went late, late, late in the summer, but we went like autumn, so it was a better place to go with the kids. I thought, \"That's a good season to live in, and that's the only season I'd like to live in\". It was late summer, but it was only hot during the day for a while, and it felt like our country's autumn weather, so I remember going abroad with the kids, and that was the last time I went abroad.\ncaller: I'm trying to enjoy foggy weather, and I'm a little too sorry for the drivers, but when I'm at home, it's so beautiful, and I love it, and when I drive, and I go out, it is so dangerous, and the fog doesn't go away easily, and it's very low, and the road is covered in fog, and it was so dangerous that I had to carry a fog lamp in the middle of the day, so I don't like foggy weather.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

According to a hotel industry official, at the annual meeting, the cake is now not just a dessert, but also a decorative ingredient on the table. These words show that now the cake is not only used as an ingredient for an event or to celebrate someone, but also has a variety of other ingredients, and so on, and so many different roles, so that the consumer thinks that there must always be a customer who is looking for a cake that is distinct from the usual cake, which is quite luxurious, and that there must be a special occasion that comes out in a year, or a special occasion, where they can feel the psychological benefits of such a cake, and so they can pay the price for it, even if the price is high.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How are you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, is that you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Mr. Kim Sang-soo has been charged with fraud and violating the Electronic Transactions Act, which is connected to the suspension of payments between account tracking inquiries, is that correct?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Right now, we're going to start tracking your accounts, and then we're gonna start tracking the financials of your account as part of the investigation process, to see if there's been any unfair profits and if you have any financial ties to any of the identified victims.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: As a result, your entire financial power is effectively suspended.\nreceiver: Does that mean you don't get the salary you're supposed to get or something?\ncaller: And that's why we now have a financial moratorium that can take anywhere from seven days to three months to complete.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So this is the part where you're applying for the Depository Protection Act, which is essentially a financial security for your livelihood, and that's why you're connected, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I'll help you with that part, but first of all, have you checked the complaint filed by either the accuser or the victim?\nreceiver: Are you talking about the recording?\ncaller: So do you know exactly what our employees were told randomly about our case?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So from now on, I'm going to tell you what I reported and what happened.\nreceiver: Please say yes.\ncaller: Yes, from now on, Mr. Kim Sang-soo, according to the statement and account tracking and opening of case number 2377 of 2015, we will start recording. If you disclose or document and leak parts of this case to a third party, you may be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to 10 million yuan for destruction of evidence in criminal cases or disciplinary cases. Please be aware of this.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: These wired recording phones have the same effect as if you came to our office and did a face-to-face examination in the recording room.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And because it can be used as evidence in court, when you're recording someone else's voice, or you're talking to someone on the phone and you're telling them about something or sharing your opinion, you could be at a disadvantage because you're being charged with tampering with evidence and conspiracy.\nreceiver: The house.\ncaller: Yes, I'm going to give you my first-hand account of what happened, and then I'll tell you about the Depositors Protection Act.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Where are the securities that you're supposed to be protecting right now?\nreceiver: It's a new bank.\ncaller: And then what?\nreceiver: I think that's all you have to do.\ncaller: So you're just going to do it for me?\nreceiver: Is that how it's supposed to be?\ncaller: Yeah, so the part of you that's covered by the Depository Protection Act right now, you're free to use it for the duration of our investigation, but the part that you didn't apply for right now, when we go into account tracing, all your financial transactions are suspended.\nreceiver: Give me a couple of places in the city.\ncaller: God and the City.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So how much of your assets do you have to protect against the IRS now?\nreceiver: Are you talking about the balance now, or the balance before it comes in?\ncaller: Yes, as of Friday, if I apply now, I'm free to use that account.\nreceiver: It's worth $39,000.\ncaller: So I'm going to make it less than $100,000.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Wait a minute. What's next for the City?\nreceiver: Two hundred thousand.\ncaller: Is it $200,000, or do you want it to be under $250,000?\nreceiver: Please don't pay more than $200.\ncaller: And besides that, don't you have any deposits or anything like that, financial instruments that you need to protect?\nreceiver: I've got a surrogate security clearance, and it's not an emergency, so I think I'll keep it.\ncaller: What about the bonds?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So you're saying that these bonds don't qualify for the Deposit Guarantee Act?\nreceiver: Just do it all for me.\ncaller: So instead of a security, instead of a bond, what's the size of the asset that needs to be protected?\nreceiver: A thousand and six hundred?\ncaller: About 1,600. Do you have this in stock?\nreceiver: It's cash.\ncaller: Wait a minute, so in the case of securities, what about the part where you make your own withdrawals?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So this is the most important part. Why don't you do this part?\nreceiver: I'm not touching it anyway.\ncaller: For example, not only Kim Sang-soo, but there are about 180 people involved in this case. I don't know if you've heard, but when we first started investigating, we found out that the people who actually received money and sold the warrants were caught. That's why we're doing this part, and now, as Kim Sang-su claims, most of the people who have been harmed by the leakage of your personal information are here.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So when we first started investigating, we stopped all the payments, we investigated, and then the leakers saw the damage, but they didn't do anything about it, and that's how we've been dealing with this since Wednesday, and we're now implementing the Depositors Protection Act.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But now, in the case of Mr. A, we're going to use account tracing to expose your liability, and we're also going to use the Depository Protection Act to protect your funds, but this part of the reason why you're applying is to upgrade your personal information so that you don't have secondary or tertiary damages in the future, so now we'll see how much of your personal information has been leaked.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, it's the part where you first figure out where the first step is, and then you help yourself to avoid getting involved in the next one.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, I'm going to have to check in with you right now. Do you have access to the Internet?\nreceiver: Right now?\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And you're going to get securities instead of Citibank, and you'll get these three types of deposit protection, and this is the part where you're saying, have you ever used internet banking or smart banking or telebanking?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Which part did you use?\nreceiver: They use internet banking and smart banking.\ncaller: You've done internet banking, you've done smart banking, have you personally, have you done a lot of online banking?\nreceiver: I do that a lot.\ncaller: There's a lot of potential for leakage in those areas, and that's why we've seen in the past that you're a little bit vulnerable in these security ratings, so I'm going to bring this up with me. Just open an Internet window.\nreceiver: Yeah, but I can't believe I just got a call.\ncaller: Yeah, well, it's an investigative procedure, and when we're done with the investigation, we'll send out a press release, but if you're going to do that, first of all, there's another phone.\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: The other call is an Internet call, and there's nothing -- oh, well, in that case, because this is a wire recording that's going on right now, and you can use it for legal documents later, we'll give you our private phone number, and just to verify, I'll put this call right back on.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Can you write it down?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you say \"yes\" to the area code 02, 6259 3259, you'll get our call for assistance.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then you press one, and you're connected directly to Information One, and I'm Sergeant Kim Jong-un, Sergeant, the lead investigator.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: As soon as you hang up, you have to put it back on, and I'm going to go right back to this recorded call.\nHi. How are you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, wait a minute. We're investigating the case 2377 of the 2015 district. Please call us immediately.

Well, I think his card had a message written on it in blue, but I don't remember what the message was.\ncaller: The information that I've explained to you is that you can't know exactly what cards your friend is using?\ncaller: Can the counselor recommend a card that matches my spending habits or patterns?

So it seems like marriage isn't about how long you're in a relationship, it's about how much you care about each other and how well you live with each other. It seems like marriage is more important than dating, because it creates friction, it creates problems that need to be solved, and it creates personality clashes.\nreceiver: Before I got married, I earned money, but I spent it on myself and thought only of myself, and when I get married, I think that wherever I go, my husband and children come first, not me.\ncaller: Before I got married, I worked, I was a socialite, and most importantly, I was my mother's daughter, but after I got married and became a wife and a daughter-in-law and had a child and became a mother, I think my thinking changed a lot, I think I changed my spending patterns, I changed my life at home, I started to take an interest in my children's education, and I started to have a lot of household chores that I didn't have in my relationship with my husband, and I think I grew up, and I feel like I've grown up a little bit, and there are a lot of things that I have to take responsibility for, and there's a lot of other things that I need to take care of myself, and when I get married and have a child, I feel like now I'm a real grown-up. Do you have anything to say to people who are in a relationship or thinking about marriage?\nreceiver: When it comes to dating, you can only think about yourself, but when it comes to marriage, you have to think about your wife, your husband, your children, your relatives.\ncaller: When I was choosing my husband, he was a soldier, so he would drink until late and then leave for work at 4:30 in the morning. He's a very decent man. If this is a man, I could believe him and marry him. I thought, after I got married and left the army, I was disappointed to see that he wasn't what I've seen him be. And on the other hand, I saw him as a young man who had no iron and loved to play, but when I saw him having a child and working steadily and trying to live as a responsible husband and father, I realized that there were many advantages, and the more I worked, the more iron I got. As much as my husband has changed, I feel that my personality has changed a lot during my marriage, and I have to take care of a lot of responsibilities and do a lot of household chores and make a living, but I also feel that I have to change a lot of my personality, just like before I got married.\nreceiver: Before I got married, I was first and foremost, and then I got married and I became so helpful, and I thought that I had changed when I saw a man who had never been to a church before getting married doing all the research without missing a single session, and I think it made me more responsible and stronger in my life, and that's how my personality changes when I have a child.\ncaller: She goes to her mother-in-law's house every weekend because her husband expects her to be nice to him, and she's close to her, and her children are good with their grandparents, and her mother and father help her a lot financially, so she goes there a lot, and she thinks it's good to date a lot.\nreceiver: You know, I think it's good to date a lot, because people have different personalities, and it's also good to meet a lot of people.\ncaller: I think it's a good idea to date a lot, because you have to meet a lot of people to know who you're going to see, and most of all, to know what kind of personality you have in common with me, and that person is someone I'm going to be with for the rest of my life, so I think you should meet a lot and choose carefully, not just that person, but your parents and your family, because these days there are so many people who don't think you'll have much contact with your in-laws because you're a nuclear family, and you don't have to live with them, and you have to take care of them because they're your parents who gave you your husband, and you can't pretend that you don' t know, and they might be great when you date them, but when you finally catch them, their personality may change, and because the advantages of dating and the advantages after marriage may be different, I think I should meet more as a person and choose marriage carefully, rather than the man I love.\nreceiver: No, I didn't know that when you two were together, but after the birth of your child and your relationship with your mother-in-law, you seem to have a lot of problems with your husband.\ncaller: When you're dating, your ideal is to be at least six feet tall, and handsome, and funny, and neat, and dressed nice, and make a lot of money on a nice car, and you're a prince with a hundred horses, and of course that's not important, it's not unimportant, but when you're married, you're above all obedient, and loyal, and responsible, and kind, and protective of me, and you don't have to be on my side, and you can't be too helpful, and it's like something has changed your ideal.\nreceiver: I have one son, and it's so hard to have a baby and raise a baby that there's no second thoughts.\ncaller: I think we mostly went to places where we could eat and drink together, because we were in Seoul when we were dating, and we usually went to restaurants on weekdays, because we both had jobs, and we met at dinner, and we went to a place where we could have drinks, and now when we're dating, we have to go to places where our kids can go, and when we want to go on a date, we take care of our kids, and we still go on a lot of dates at restaurants, cinemas, coffee shops, and so on.\nreceiver: They're responsible, they're loyal, they care a lot about their families, but they're stressed out because they're too big to care about their families.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Can you tell us the address, the exact address?\nreceiver: What's the address?\ncaller: Yeah, yeah, whatever you do.\nreceiver: Yeah, hold on a second.\ncaller: Make it your home.\nreceiver: Yes, please send it to my office.\ncaller: Yeah, was that a situation where you needed a little security?\nreceiver: No, that's not it.\ncaller: It's not like that.\nreceiver: I'm still in the office.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Wait a minute, you'd be better off visiting that employee, wouldn't you, rather than sending him to the elevator?\nreceiver: Oh, that employee.\ncaller: We'll send it to you by elevator, and you can take it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then you have to write it in this elevator and send it to us, and then you go to the post office, because it's a hassle, and when our staff visits, they say, \"Wait a minute\", and then you read it there, because we'll send you both the corporate and the personal archives, and you'll read it carefully and sign it, and ask for a withdrawal, and you can have it that same day.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You don't want to be a nuisance, do you?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: So we're going to do a staff visit, and, wait a minute, I'm going to check the schedule of our staff to see when they're available.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: How are you?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Would you be available to us on the eighth day of the week?\nreceiver: Eight days?\ncaller: Yeah, how about Friday?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Are you comfortable in the morning, comfortable in the afternoon?\nreceiver: Uh, it was lunchtime.\ncaller: In the middle of lunch?\nreceiver: Between eleven and twelve.\ncaller: Well, then, sir, if it's not the eighth day of the week but the tenth day of the next week, do you have time for lunch on Monday?\nreceiver: Is it okay for me to write this late?\ncaller: Oh, yes, you can, because that's where we send it.\nreceiver: Oh, well, I'd rather you did it in the morning.\ncaller: I'll get you on the eighth day.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Your client lives in the city of Son Nam, but did you receive it from the San-Wamani Department of Commerce?\nreceiver: Oh, my home is in Sunnam, yes.\ncaller: Ah, okay, wait a minute. You're done now, customer. And then we'll tell you one more situation. You come out with a ten-day point of sale at two thousand two hundred and you come out with forty-eight thousand three hundred eighty-one eight hundred thirty-seven. You'll be out thirty days. We're sorry if this three-year reorganization lasts, but the interest rate may fluctuate. So if the three-month reorganization continues, it's fine until the second reorganization.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: It's the same with private equity as with other types of financing, but it's also the case with us that once you're a corporate citizen, you're going to have a very bad credit rating, and I'm sorry to say that, but if you look at it this way, corporate citizenship is a very sensitive commodity, and more than anything else, so I'd like to recommend that you pay a lot of attention to corporations, because it's an incentive.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So now we've got the estimated time, and I think you're going to have to wait until about 5:30 to 5:40 at our estimated time. You've been working a lot today, and it's cold, and you've been struggling with whether or not you're working in the field, and if you're using the security card again, we'll get back to you as soon as we have the results.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you have any questions or requests?\nreceiver: No, not yet.\ncaller: Oh, and the customer of the middleman, who seems to have a very bad quality, don't talk to him, the customer, because this could be a problem on our side too, if you mess up. Don't even get in touch with the mountain, the customer. Maybe the transmission data is not updated because you are passing it to us, and there may be something automatically sent to you because of the macro, text or call. Do not receive it, the client. Anyway, we will solve everything in two hours. Please be patient for two hours. I will contact you as soon as you get the results.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

We're also a bad country, to be honest, but I think there are a lot of really bad people. On the contrary, our bad people help more people, and then you think it's North Korea. I don' t understand why the North Koreans come to our country and blow up, and then regret it, and then give us rice and food from our government.\nreceiver: I think that we have chosen a good president of our country, and I think that there is no such thing as a completely personal president than the previous presidents. I know that he does not spare sacrifices and efforts for the country, but people make mistakes, and there are mistakes that people make. If everyone saves a little and understands and supports a lot, then the president can do more and have better policies, jobs and social safety nets for our people.\ncaller: I don't know much about business yet, but I think it's a mess these days, the economy is just fighting each other for what's right and wrong, and you're fighting each other on policy, and it looks like I'm saying, \"Do something, do something\", and North Korea is launching missiles like North Korea, and it doesn't seem like there's any people living in the country, and the economy is getting worse, and it's getting worse, but it's not really anything, and it seems like there are so many dead people that people in our country are talking about this as if it's just a bread shop, and I really don't see how we're going to be able to rebuild our country after this collapse, or whether we'll be able to go back to the way it was before, or whether there's going to be any peace, and I just hope that this corona ends one day soon, and if that's all there is, then everything will be fine.\nreceiver: President Moon Jae-in, I think you've been doing a good job with your policy on North Korea, and there have been no signs of any nuclear tests, and I've heard that we've been responding with a lot of other countries, including the United States, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and so on, and I think it's the first time in my life that I've met the president of the United States twice, and that kind of publicity and publicity about North Korea, in a way, has played a role in compensating for that, and it seems to be a one-way street, trying to reduce that gap a lot in the distant future when our country is united by developing the economy of North Korea.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

We didn't teach that exercise for half a million yuan, it's online, so it's how to play table tennis, see online, so if I did, our Zumba teacher, so this time I uploaded it, but I'm a little too passionate, so we're taking too much time off, so yes, no, that must be left behind as evidence, so whatever, the kids who teach like that in their own way, Katoch also captures what they're doing, but we don't answer there, and we didn't run for the first time, but last time, they said, but our teacher does that, so we are not part of the West, so we say yes, so the teacher uploaded it again, why do I have to start practicing more and more, so now we have to raise that kind of money\nreceiver: Well, I haven't seen it yet. Well, they have a little bit more support from the country than my mother did yesterday, and my mother didn't do anything, but I don't know where my mother does it, and I'm in a cheap place, and in the country, her teacher does Zumba dance, my mother does, but there's some money coming out of the country, and that's a little bit of money coming out, so it's between the members to collect a little money and give them 100,000 won or 200,000 won once a month like this, so I mean, periodically, so I said, \"Look, these teachers are hard to replace\". Well, this is not at all, but they're running around three times a day, so they're hard because they don't have a job at all, so they do nothing, so if it's not the most difficult place, people will do a little less, but I remember that story.\ncaller: I've only seen it once, but, yeah, but, uh, but maybe we don't have a lot of tables, but it's half a million dollars, so our Zumba teacher will get more.\nreceiver: I don't know how many times I've done it, how many classes I've taken, but I'm not going to give it to you because you're just spending the country's money.\ncaller: But I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it now because of the coronavirus, and we're doing it underground, and there's no ventilation.\nreceiver: I don't know what's going to happen next year, but my fiancé has spent money on my health club, and he's not doing it anymore, so this is supposed to be the third time that Phillip has been there, but the third time is already full, so I'm doing it now, and I haven't done it, and I'm just forgetting about the money, so I said, \"I'm going to talk to you\", and he said, \"We're talking about our fiancé, but we haven't talked about it\".\ncaller: I've done it twice before, and I've asked them to do it again, so we've had a four-month or five-month break, and I don't think we've done more than five times, so that's what annoys me. I should have done ten performances in advance, but after a couple of months, and I said, \"You can't do it again\", and then I did it again and again and again, because you can't go there, do it again because you can only do it once or twice, so you couldn't do that.\nreceiver: So I did, and I've been with my fiancé three times, and I know that, so I did it three times, because then I didn't, but then the rules are the rules, but now it's a special corona situation, so you can go and talk to him yesterday, and then you have to do something for a month or two, and that's not going to give you any more benefits, so you just have to keep doing it for a year, so you don't just keep doing it, so you're too short of money, and now our fiancé is a year apart, so we're going to take a year off, and then we're just going to go out on the boat, and so I bought that, and then I said, \"Hey, what's up, I bought a bike at home, but I'm not exercising, and our name is not one, and now I'm gaining weight, but I don't think it's going to work because we've got the best walking machine in the house, but today my fiancé is really wearing a walking machine, and it's all right, and then my

it as a bracelet, but if you just buy it once or twice, when you think about it, when you look at it, it's like,\ncaller: We're in the room with Tivi.\nreceiver: If you don't have a TV in the living room, or if you see a TV in your living room, you can just do this, and then you can move that, and you can't move the treadmill, and then it folds up like this, and it's a little heavy, but if you fold it up and move it like this, you can move it, and we just put it in our living room.\ncaller: You're going to lose weight.\nreceiver: But it's better than not doing it, and I'm trying to avoid taking the elevator at all costs these days, unless you have a heavy load, so I'm wearing sneakers when I take out the trash these days, and I used to just drag my sleeping bags with me, but now I'm putting on my sneakers and going up, and I just want to do it like this, and I think it's a lot better if I just go up to the 15th floor and then come down to the right and then come up to our house like this.\ncaller: I'll have to buy that bike, we don't even have that name, but I asked him to buy it, and this is how he hangs on, and this guy is wearing it, and his shoulders are a little bit wider, and he doesn't, so it seems to be shrinking, so our friend, our husband, his friend's son, he was wearing a mask, but he wore a mask, and how do you exercise, and we just walk, and we wear it, and we climb the stairs, and we can't breathe, and he wears it, but he has to do it, and he has to exercise, and build up his strength, and that's how I fought again, because now Hell is one of the most dangerous places in the world.\nreceiver: So our groom keeps taking a break, and now he has to do it from next month, and that's exactly what he did, and then he said he can't do it without wearing a mask, and he doesn't exercise, and so he said he's not allowed to wear a mask, but he's allowed to take a break, so he's here, and then we have this pedal, which is the cheapest thing I've ever had, and it's only ten or fourteen thousand dollars, so it's just a bicycle, but we're on the top step of the meat hook with a handle like a rubber band, so the rubber band is connected like this, so you stretch out your arms like this, and you hold it like this, it's a rubber rope, and you sit like this, you stop buying it, there's a step, step one, step two, step three, and you keep going, so the bike is set up, and then you say, \"That's fine, that's fine\", and then you send it to him, and he says, \"It's okay, you can\ncaller: But you said you didn't like high-speed driving.\nreceiver: Well, I guess this is our groom, and he and I aren't spending as much time together as we used to.\ncaller: Even if you're in the mountains, and you're this close, and you do this, you're going to meet people like this, even if you wear a mask.\nreceiver: And it's raining, so I'm going to go to the mountains one more time, but we're not going because it's hot and raining.\ncaller: Look, name3 and name4 are at dawn, and they don't seem to do that just once, they seem to do it often.\nreceiver: Anyway, no, I see name4 and name3 every once in a while, and I don't see them very often, but there are times when we meet like beans in a real drought, and when we meet, something doesn't become so stable, and when you talk like this with your sister and me like this, it becomes stable, and you keep talking like this, and this place is like this, this ass is heavy, and they're just like, you have to do something.\ncaller: I mean, no, I mean, you know, we're just going to go somewhere else, and, uh, name four used to swim at dawn, but these days, I don't swim anymore.\nreceiver: I used to swim and he used to play table tennis, but now I don't think he does, so name3 wants to buy that hat, does he work out, the hat with the window, he wants to buy it, but that's only 10 cents in the department store, they don't have a discount on the outlet, so I'd rather go to the department store and buy it.\ncaller: But name4 wanted to gain weight, so why did he exercise so much?\nreceiver: He's a chubby guy, he doesn't want to gain weight, so he exercises to gain weight and it hurts a little bit, and he's sick all the time because he can't eat, he's always sick and his strength isn't as strong as his style, and then he's dry, and he has this belly ache, and

What's the tax rate?\ncaller: So the houses that we're looking at are between 6,000 and 100,000,000.\nreceiver: What happens to the loan amount?\ncaller: It's about 4,000 to 8,000.\nreceiver: So you're not done writing the world charter yet?\ncaller: Uh, yeah, I haven't written it yet.\nreceiver: Are you the one who wants to borrow money?\ncaller: It's you.\nreceiver: What's the income going to be?\ncaller: We've been open for less than a year, and we haven't made any money.\nreceiver: Yes, please state your monthly payment for local health insurance.\ncaller: It's about minus 25,000.\nreceiver: What about generations?\ncaller: This is me.\nreceiver: Have you paid for more than three months?\ncaller: Yes, he did.\nreceiver: What was your combined credit card and checking account usage last year?\ncaller: Uh, it's about a billion to two billion yuan.\nreceiver: If you're under the age of 34, or if you're a married couple, do you qualify for a polygamous marriage?\ncaller: You're under 34 years old, and you have a deaf child in your care.\nreceiver: What about home ownership?\ncaller: Uh, homeless people.\nreceiver: Have you ever borrowed anything?\ncaller: I have $5 million in student loans, and I have $30 million in credit union business loans.\nreceiver: What kind of house is it that you're moving into, an apartment, an office, a multi-family home, a condo?\ncaller: We're looking at multi-generational housing or office buildings.\nreceiver: Where are you moving to?\ncaller: This is Seoul.\nreceiver: Do you know your credit score?\ncaller: We were rated second-rate by the credit union when we applied for the loan.\nreceiver: What's the approximate date?\ncaller: Uh, the house is still unfinished.\nreceiver: I've checked your basics, and I was wondering if you could fill me in on the details.\ncaller: As I said, I opened my shop in December last year, and I'm the general manager, and I filed my income tax returns and my expense tax returns, and it's less than a year old, so I haven't seen any income.\ncaller: In January of next year, we'll be able to file an income tax return because we've been operating for a year, but according to our tax returns, it's almost impossible for the A-banks to reimburse us.\ncaller: First of all, uh, so let's do a search first, and what we found is a pre-tax loan for the elderly, but this doesn't show any income, but it looks like the minimum amount for the unemployed is going to be 3,000.\ncaller: So you go to the homepage, you type in all this information, and you look at it, and theoretically, it's going to say, 27,700,000 dollars.\ncaller: But with the money I have and the extra loan of 3,000, I don't think I can afford to buy as many houses as I want, so I'd like to borrow some more, and I think 2 to 3% interest would be fine.\ncaller: We don't really have a set number yet, but we want to go to at least 3,000 to 100,000,000.\ncaller: If you go to the bank and talk to them, you have to come to their house and give them an address and do a search, and then you have to know roughly how much they're going to borrow, and it's not that easy to look for a home based on that amount, but you want to know how much you can borrow roughly.\nreceiver: It's true what they say about banks: the borrowing limit is determined by the home equity and the credit rating.\ncaller: Oh, is that so?\nreceiver: So you have to go to the charging station to find out what your credit limit is.\ncaller: Well, is it possible to borrow more than 3000?\nreceiver: Well, if it's just credit and a pre-owned house, 3,000 is certainly possible.\ncaller: Well, if you want to borrow only from a bank or an accredited institution in the first place, but you want to avoid these kinds of large mortgages, is that possible?\nreceiver: Yes, it's possible in financial sector one.\ncaller: Well, if the power supply's okay, what's the limit?\nreceiver: The interest rate is 2 to 3 percent, 80 to 90 percent of the full amount, up to 400 million yuan.\ncaller: Can I prove that I have a negative income? Well, I'm paying quite a lot of health insurance. What do I need to prove my income for a loan to go through?\ncaller: It depends on the limit, so if you submit both the business and the health plan, and you check your financials, can you confirm the limit? There's an expectation, but we've almost paid it all.\ncaller: Uh, yeah, my name's on the business license, and I'm a business owner.\ncaller: Well, I'll have the business registration, the financial statements, the application form and the Global Compact document ready for you.\ncaller: Can we get the results back on the same day?\ncaller: You're welcome to come with me to the autopsy.\ncaller: Do you think it's possible for a husband and wife to share the same name?\ncaller: It's a copy, is it?\ncaller: So the loan and the mortgage have to be identical, but can they be co-signed?\ncaller: Oh yes thank you.

What do you think about autumn and winter?\nreceiver: I also love autumn and winter, and autumn has its own characteristics, and in autumn, there's a trail in the forest on the Hanra Mountain Ring Road, but when it gets to October, there are so many people around the ring road, whether tourists, imperialists or vehicles, that it's impossible to drive. I didn't know that the forest path was such a good place before, so I walked on it, and that's why so many people come. When you get off the bus at the entrance to the forest in the middle of the road, you walk along the path to the ring road and you see the forest and you know how beautiful it is. I also love the forest path, and my sister said that it was nice to go to the mountain ridge in winter, and then I wondered if you had a good experience going somewhere else.\ncaller: It's cold as winter, and when it snows, you go to the mountains, but you go to see the snow, but I've been to the dwarf forest road in autumn, and it's really nice there, and there are a lot of people, and there's a lot of cars lined up, and I can see why so many people are looking for it. If you really want to see the dwarf wood road, it is really beautiful. If you go up to the greenhouse, there is a windy rock. It's also cool and beautiful.\nreceiver: The southern side, I think, especially in autumn, when you go to the southern part of the park, it's very prosperous, and if you go south, the road itself is very beautiful, so in the autumn, you go south very often, because you're surrounded by the swans and the birds, and you go south a lot, and then you go south and sometimes you go around the park, and you see the horses and the grass all mixed together, and it's kind of healing and stress-relieving, so sometimes I think maybe you're going south, and she said that autumn is the best time of the year, so let me know if there's any good places to go in the spring, or if there are any good places.\ncaller: In the spring, it's probably cherry blossoms. At the time of cherry bloom, cherry flowers bloom beautifully in the orchard, and at the entrance gate to the University of Jersey, cherry blooms are really beautiful. When cherry blosms bloom, or when cherry trees bloom, there's nowhere else to go near the lake, and there's only one orchard near the house, because the orchard is close to home. Sometimes I go there, and the real cherry bloses are so beautiful and bloom when they bloom, because they have their own cherries and white cherries, and they're beautiful. Cherry flowers are beautiful too.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How much is that?\ncaller: So if you say today we're going to go with the minimum amount, it's going to be a limit of one or three hundred, and that's a little bit of a cost request, but if the amount you said you need is actually about three million yuan.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So we're going to generate six hundred units, and you'll be charged a couple of hundred dollars for that, and two months after that, you'll get an offer from us for 30 million won.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: All right, well, we're gonna go ahead and make this disappear.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

You know that now.\nreceiver: Yes, I know.\ncaller: Well, for now, we're going to compare what the FCA knows about the financial system with what you know about it, and then we'll do a comparative analysis of the financial system that you're using, so if you're telling the truth, which banks do you use besides the Farmers Bank and the One Bank that created the Fed?\nreceiver: It's a personal financial matter, and I can't talk about it.\ncaller: And that's because it's a cannery that was opened in your name, and because of that cannery, a lot of people are suffering right now.\nreceiver: But that's my personal information, and I can't give it to you right now, because the agency hasn't verified that I'm accurate.\ncaller: If you don't have a warrant, we'll send you a subpoena, and you can go there, you can go here, you can bring your ID, your citizenship card.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, if you'll just send me the subpoena, I'll have a look at it.\ncaller: You're not checking in, you're supposed to come and check in when the subpoena arrives, this is an investigative position, not that you're checking in or not checking out.\nreceiver: There's too much of that in Korea these days, so I'll have to investigate on my own.\ncaller: And I'm kind of confused about answering the phone right now, because every time I make a call, there's a lot of people who are doing voice-spying or buying houses, and there's so many people who are taking them and putting in a subpoena or something like that.\nreceiver: Send me a summons, and I'll go.\ncaller: Yes, sir, as soon as the subpoena arrives, please pick it up and come.\nreceiver: Yes, I understand.

She's had a cast for about three months after her leg surgery. I went to the hospital yesterday, and she said she needs a cast that's blue and thin, so I really like it, and she called me this morning and said thank you, but honestly, I haven't done much for her, and that's why it's embarrassing to say thank you, and I'm sorry.\nreceiver: I don't know if it's hard for me to feel sorry for my mother-in-law, but I'm the kind of person who hopes that if I do something, she'll do it better, and if I don' t do it, she' ll make things worse. But I've never felt sorry for or grateful to her in my entire life, so I' m always jealous of her, even if she' s only my sister-in-laws. No, I' m a person who lives with the idea that everyone else' s in-laws are jealous.\ncaller: Yes, yes, I'm feeling fine, you should go and have lunch with your mother-in-law, but lately I haven't been able to do that. You know, last time we went to Kimjang, you know, because of her legs, we went there for the first time, and I didn't like it, and this is the first time I've done it. I hope she doesn't get sick, and if she does, I'll take all that.\nreceiver: I've got a demon inside of me, and it's not that I don't want to, it's just that I'm so stressed out and I'm yelling at you, and it is so hard, and I can't think of anything, and if I could just clear my head, I think I'd be happier.\ncaller: No, it's not okay at all. We've got our own car and license plates these days. It's my car. But changing my car again isn't human. I can't think of how to change my car every time.\nreceiver: My fiancé doesn't have a craving for cars, but I don't have any money, so he doesn't get cravings. With that money, he has to buy booze, feed the kids, buy movie tickets for the staff, and so on. He's the one who ruined the project.\ncaller: I was having dinner with name3 last night, and my mother got a call from name4. I asked her what was going on, and she kept saying that name4 was right for name3 and that she was crying and came home. She said, \"Yes, you can play with him\", but then she said, \"No, he keeps hitting me on purpose\". So I checked it out, gave him a call, and he hung up. Then I asked name3, and he said, \"Of course, you've done this and that\". Naturally, I was proud of the fact that name4 had his head down with a toy, but he didn't know that.\nreceiver: Your sister and your brother and your brother are the right kind of people, so they'll learn from that, because it's part of the process of raising a child, and I'm thinking that there's nothing I can do about it. I don't think that name3 really has a bad feeling about that name4 kid, and beat him up, and that's not just because he didn't mean it. I think that because of that, name3 will grow up to be a bright, healthy, and right kind of kid.\ncaller: That's right, I can do that too. Name1 is the best. In that case, you're right, but she's not good. This time, name5 hits the fig tree and gets insurance money from the city.\nreceiver: And then the table in the dining room gets bigger and bigger, and name5 still walks around and gets knocked around and lives, but it's a big deal. I don't want to be a strict person because I don' t want to take money, and it' s comfortable and name5 is also a good kid, I think that name5 is really the best kind of genius kids to look forward to in the future.\ncaller: I used to think my brother was a great kid who always got 100 points, but nowadays I don't think so. Name5 doesn't do well in his English studies. He's wrong a lot. I get calls from teachers and I'm so hard to live with these days. Name3 breaks bread once a day. Name5 also breaks bread.\nreceiver: name6 does a lot of work, but it's not that big. It's really small, so it's going to cost a lot of money, but it doesn't matter if it's a big deal or not. It doesn't mean that name6 doesn't have an accident, or the insurance company doesn't make enough money. And I'm talking about studying English, because name6 started studying English in the fifth grade, but when it gets hard, you don't start studying. You have to be consistent with the words you say.\ncaller: I'm worried that our name5 is going to be a teenager, so he's a bit silly, and he's going to do things behind the scenes, so I'm afraid that when he's an adolescent, he'll do things more loudly, but now he's chatting with his girlfriend, and to be honest, I'm also a bit worried, because sometimes when I sneak in, it's just over, because he's still a little bit of a name5 compared to her, I don't know what to say, but he's doing that because his level is a little bit lower, and this kid has some ideas, and he shows some signs of sex on his body, and if his level goes up a little bit, I think it's over, and I'm concerned about name3 as well, he's breaking bread like this for the first year, and when I'm a teenager I'm always afraid that I'll be called to school to become a policeman, or I'm thinking about sending him to school now, but I'm sure he'll be better, but I believe that's one\nreceiver: I don't care much about name5 because name5 can go anywhere, but name3 is not a man. We should send both male and female engineers. Maybe not so much less. Girls are pressured to go to male and female engineering, and middle school loses its masculinity on the equator. So I recommend girls to press. Name5 is fine wherever they go, they adapt well wherever they are.\ncaller: I don't think you want to live in the world. All your exams are good. Come see what's going on. Name1a, let's just send a bachelor's degree. English was extra. No, no, no, we should have extra. Let's add math too.\nreceiver: Your sister Seoul is my hope, my hope and my pride, and the moment I am Seoul, I want to recognize you for such a service and raise you as a child who will be able to take care of your children's homework when the holidays are over.\ncaller: I'm going to make you do three things every time I come.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I know it.\nreceiver: I don't really know how to find a deli, but a friend recommended it to me, and I can't remember exactly what it's called, but there's a chef there, and when he's not there, it's different. When he's there, the salmon soup is really delicious, and when you eat a salmon, the salmon oil spreads and the fish balls go down your throat like this, and I love that feeling so much that every time I get paid, I keep looking for it, and then you come with me.\ncaller: I don't know about you, but I really like to go out and find places like taverns, so there's all sorts of things, from fast food to snacks to Indian curries, and I'd like to recommend to you that there's a place called Dukkukukukuk in the sanctuary, and it's got a really delicious cucumber sauce, and you can take a quick bite of the roasted cucumber with a little bit of mayonnaise sauce and then you can put it on a piece of gum, and then you put it in your mouth and you can poison it right in your mouth, and there's nothing happier than that, and besides, there's this big place called Rajmahal in the Sanctuary that has a curry with a coconut base that makes it so soft that you can have butter garlic on the side and then you squeeze it up and you can feed it to a bird.\nreceiver: I don't know if you remember, when I was in high school, we used to go to this place called Daol Kim Baab, and they used to have this food that they put on top of the pancakes and the lemonade and the fried kim baab, and I used to eat it a lot in high school and I almost liked it so much in my high school that I would call it soul food, and I would go there a lot, and it was cheap, and it tasted good, and there was a lot of it, and you could just go out with your friends and have a lot of memories of that food, and you've been going there a lot lately, and you have soul food.\ncaller: When I think about it, my soul food is the same as my mother's Kimchi Chips. My mother made a bunch of them, and the pork got in the can and dried up, and they were cooked a little bit more thoroughly than the other ones, and they melted when Kimchi came in your mouth, and this one has a slightly different flavor from the usual Kimchi chips, but my mother put a little bit of sugar in it, and it tasted sweet and sour, and then fried it with white rice, and then baked it, and then three of these, and then you eat it together, and that's the thing that I remember most about the army, and I don't have as much soul food as this one, which was just Kimchi Chicks, and I haven't had that much money lately, so I'm not sure what kind of delicious food I've eaten lately, when you think about it.\nreceiver: When I think about the best food I've eaten in a while, my friend came down from the mainland and recommended me some jellybeans, and I went to eat some of the jellybean ribs from that YouTube trailer, and it's in the garden, and it tastes a little bit different, but it's a little bit spicy, and I've never eaten anything like that before, but there's a lot of people, and it got a lot of attention on YouTube, and then I thought, well, that's the best thing I've ever eaten in the last three months, and that's really good, because there's so much jellybeane, and if you cook it all the way up there, it's really delicious.\ncaller: I've got a cooking license, and I'm a certified gourmet chef, and I have my own cooking, and yet I think the only thing that I can give to people around me and get them to accept me as a cook is chicken soup. I think it's a food that makes a lot of difference depending on the skill of the person who cooks it, whether the food is crispy or it's roasted or the liver is well-fitted or it smells or something like that. Recently, there's a name among our friends. I came to our house recently and I cooked a chicken once, and I heard that it tasted better than Chicken soup sold in a Chinese restaurant, and my shoulders shuddered. On the contrary, you are a good cook.\nreceiver: I usually don't care about cooking, so I just eat what's in the fridge pretty hot, but when I really don't have anything to eat, sometimes I fry eggs, and I think I'm really good at fried eggs, because they're not fried, and they're cooked properly, and they taste better than any other food.\ncaller: If you want to list the foods that I don't like, it's seafood like whales or seafood like bruises and stuff like that, and there's a common reason for all the things that I dislike is that they smell like the ocean a lot. When I was a kid, I don' t know why, but after I finished school, I went on a bike ride with my friends to a lake swimming pool, where I was supposed to be able to see the ocean, and I couldn' t swim, so I jumped in the ocean. It was summer, and I was eating so much sea water, and the sea water made my skin so salty, and then I lost a pair of shoes, and I have a very bad memory, and that' s why I didn' t like the smell of the ocean, so I hate seafood that smells like the sea, and even when Kim gets sick, he doesn' t get sick, or when he touches the water, the sea smells a little bit lighter, and then he doesn't eat it, except when he' squeaks.\nreceiver: I've noticed that you don't really say much, and I didn't know you didn't like it, but mint chocolate tastes good, and you should try it, because that's what people get when they taste toothpaste, and they're prejudiced, and they feel that way, because I don't like chocolate.\ncaller: When I go to McDonald's, my favorite burger is a 1955 burger, and since then, my favorite thing is a shrimp burger with shrimp in it, and I don't know if it's weird, but there's a sauce in this burger, and it's kind of like, \"Oh, my God, that's so sweet, it's so spicy, it tastes so sweet today\".\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Well, in the case of Germany, they are people who admit their guilt for the Second World War and atone for it, but in Japan, they have their own guilt and hide it, and there is no such thing. I think it might be the Japanese government's Japanese nationalism.\ncaller: Yes, that's what I think about Japan, but I personally don't like the fact that they've been criticizing our country for a long time, but there's another advantage to this country called Japan, which is that they have a kind of cohesion of their own, and if you say that they think about the country, it's a little bit right-wing, strong ethnicity, and I'm a little bit freaked out sometimes, so let's just keep talking about North Korea, and I say that I think that a country called Japan is quite warm, but it's quite dangerous as our neighboring country, and I think personally, but honestly, isn't Japan as dangerous to Japan as North Korea is to our country?\nreceiver: It's probably more dangerous than saying that our country is dangerous, but it's more dangerous to think that our country looks down on us because we're a people that was suppressed and oppressed by the Japanese, and maybe they used to dominate us more than us, especially I think it's the Japanese politicians who are the problem. I think that the relationship with Korea has deteriorated since Abe came to power. I think it was different before when Prime Minister Koizumi or his predecessor was in power.\ncaller: The harsh sentiment comes from the past, and now it's so-called normal in this country, but I've been thinking about it personally a lot, and I know that we hate Japan, and we know that this sentiment is too much for us, and we also know that we are hostile to Japan, but anyway, because the flow of time is a win-win game, we have to cooperate a little bit more economically with Japan, a little bit closer to that difficult market economy, so I think there is a counterargument. It's Japan's past security issues, and many of our country, and frankly, we've done a lot of things that are cancerous, so there's no part of the border with Japan, so now the world is a game where we win-win with each other, so our country is too friendly to China, so we have to be a little more friendly to Japan or the United States, especially to Japan, so that our country's economy is good in all respects.\nreceiver: Yes, I agree with you. Recently in Japan, because of the drama with Moon Jae-in, there's been a wave of negative sentiment, and now the Japanese government is criticizing South Korea in a negative way, and I would like to see that wave disappear, but then again, recently there's a third wave, and I think that Japanese youth and three generations are feeling good feelings about South Korea through these media and music, and I don't think that's reflected in the Japanese government right now, but they're just blocking communication with our country or something like that, and they're not conducting it well.\ncaller: Yes, I can understand that, because I see that Koreans also have a certain amount of the past, of course, to be cleared, especially towards our country, but it's like drinking in a bar, or then friendship, this side, that side, barbecue, or some other kind of disgusting language, and then they say something future-oriented, and then when they have a lot of cultural exchanges with each other, the feelings that were narrow between them now are broader, and the spectrum is broader, I personally think.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

You're going through the upper post office, and then you'll have all these things attached to you on the side of the road where we're coming from, the time of attendance and the date of attendance, and you'll be discharged at that time, so you can come in and get checked out.\nNow, if you've lost contact or haven't attended, even though there's no obvious reason and no specific, real reason, then you realize that you may be the receiver.\nreceiver: Where did you say your caller is from?\ncaller: I'm a double investigator for two high-profile crime teams at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department.\ncaller: Hello, we know you're in attendance.\nreceiver: Yes, yes, we know you're in attendance, but we're just recording and we'll wrap up now, so if you've decided that you're going to be in attendance right now, and you want to be very careful about this part of the date, and if there's any secondary damage or a fire that occurs during that time period, please report it immediately.\nreceiver: Where should I go?\ncaller: Please contact our office at 02-530-3114\nreceiver: I'm not going to be able to make it.\ncaller: You can't reach me on a direct line, because we're an investigative agency, and we don't get calls because of investigative requests or things like that, and if that damage happens and you want to hold us accountable or something like that doesn't happen, you agree with that now?\nreceiver: You don't hold the agency accountable.\ncaller: Yeah, so you're okay with that? Yeah, so that's the date that I can go over it, set a date, and send it to the right hand side of the equation.\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: And then I'm just going to wait for the subpoena.\ncaller: Yes, you can just wait.

Because it's connected, and it's happening now, and we have to investigate it.\nreceiver: All right, I'll wait for you then.\ncaller: I'm sure you will.\nreceiver: And what I can do right now is,\ncaller: Yes, we just called to tell you how to do it, but you said you'd be here soon, so it's more convenient for us to come.\nreceiver: I mean, is there any other way to not go?\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: What's the best way not to go?\ncaller: We've talked about this before, and we've said that because of this case, we've now created a privacy breach reporting center on the website of the DA's office.

You opened two accounts that you didn't even know about.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: I'm telling you that additional accounts can be opened later, and that's how account tracking and security measures are implemented to prevent further damage that you don't know about now.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Secondly, I'd like to make a brief statement about the financial instruments that you're currently trading.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: You know, we're an investigative agency now, so we're not going to ask you for any personal information, like account numbers or passwords.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Where are the wallets that you can legally visit or open on your mobile phone in your name?\nreceiver: Do I have to tell you what I'm writing right now?\ncaller: Yes, that's right.\nreceiver: I'm writing about the Straits, and Shinin Bank, and Kakao Bank, and all that stuff, because back in the day, Kay Bank was built, but it wasn't being used because it was a little out of date.\ncaller: Okay, so the Straits, Shinhan, Kakao, Kay Bank, how many accounts have been opened in your name on the Straits side?\nreceiver: I don't know if it's something you've been using for a long time, or something you're using now, like a check card.\ncaller: On the bright side?\nreceiver: Shinhan has a country love card.\ncaller: Yeah, what about cacao?\nreceiver: I'll have a cacao and a cayenne.\ncaller: Once you've made your statement, we'll pass it on to the Financial Supervisory Commission.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: We're going to go through the data, and if we find any other accounts that you haven't disclosed, we'll treat them as if they were created by a criminal, not you, and then we'll freeze them.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: It's like the first bank, instead of the securities.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: For every account, for every currency, there's an account, a regular account, right?\nreceiver: You are all cheque cards.\ncaller: Do you have any additional savings, deposits, mortgages, stocks, funds, bonds, or other assets?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Well, with the exception of Kakao, Kay Bank, and Shinhan, did you go to the window and open it yourself, or did you open it with a mobile prize?\nreceiver: Ah Shin Han, I'm the one who opened it.\ncaller: You opened it. What about your parents?\nreceiver: Maybe they didn't open it by then.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. Uh, any additional accounts other than those mentioned above have been frozen by us.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: Finally, I'd like to make a brief statement about your legal assets.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: The same reason we ask about the quantitative part is that if you're doing a survey and the margin of error is too large, you're not going to be able to do it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: To find out if it's the proceeds of crime or if you're legally entitled to a portion of your earnings.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You say you have an account, what are your approximate legal assets?\nreceiver: The one you have now?\ncaller: This is the balance of the balance sheet.\nreceiver: Oh, I'm between 60 and 70 right now.\ncaller: You're between 60 and 70 years old.

Is there anything you're wondering or not understanding?\nreceiver: No, not at all.\ncaller: Yes, if you have any questions, it's a recording phone, so I've called the Seoul Police Department, and if you'd like an investigator, I'll change it right away.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: He worked hard to get investigated.\nreceiver: Thank you.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Which of the four seasons do you hate the most?\nreceiver: Of the four seasons, summer is the one I hate the most, because it's the hottest and the wettest, and I don't like the heat, so I hate summer the most, and there are a lot of mosquitoes, and they're ferocious, and, uh, in the summer, I hate the summer season the most, but I think it's a good thing that we can do things like swimming in the water or skydiving now.\ncaller: I love the snowy season, I love the snow weather, and I remember going to the countryside when the snow had melted, carrying bags of rice paddies, and snow sledding in the mountains with my cousins, my brothers and sisters, and making snowmen, and riding snow sleds, and enjoying the thrill, and I loved the snow weather in winter, and I liked snow sledding the most.\nreceiver: If I had to pick the most memorable of all the seasons, I'd say it's winter, because that's when I met my girlfriend and started dating, and that was the biggest of all the moments, like the sweaters and the memories, because it's the winter that I remember the most, and when it snows in the winter, I have the best memories, and that's why I think winter is the season that I remember most, and if the seasons change now, what season would you like to change to?\ncaller: Now that it's the beginning of June, the beginning of summer, I actually prefer autumn or spring, because it's so hot, and the humidity is so high, and it's hard to go out and sweat, and I prefer the breezy spring and autumn, and I like being outdoors and enjoying the breeze, and I would like to change it to spring or autumn, because you said you hate summer the most, but do you have any good memories of the summer season?\nreceiver: There aren't many memories of the best summer seasons, but if you have to pick one, it's when I went with my friends to the valley in Don Naco, and it was a real summer, and the valley was as cold as an iceberg, and I didn't know it was summer, but I was amazed.\ncaller: I don't actually live in the state, but I've been traveling to the state for a week now, and I've never experienced the summer heat of the state, and if I'm going to be in the state for the long term, I'd like to spend the whole summer in a lodge overlooking the ocean, and play in front of it all day long, and have a nice vacation with a cold bunch of hanlala eed, because we have four seasons in this country, and if you could stay in any other country, would you want to stay in any country that has any of the seasons?\nreceiver: I've never traveled abroad before, so I don't know where to go, because I have no information about other countries or anything like that, but just like people are drawn to the opposite image, if it's summer now, when you say you're going abroad, you want to go to a country that has an opposite season.\ncaller: I haven't really been to Korea, so I've never really enjoyed it, but if I get to Korea for a longer period of time and I can enjoy the autumn, and I'm not able to enjoy any of the festivals because of the coronavirus right now, and things get better in the fall, and we have an autumn festival in Korea, I would love to do it. You said that you hate summer the most, and what's your favorite fruit?\nreceiver: My favorite fruit is probably a lot of watermelon, or seaweed, because it's so moist and you sweat a lot in the summer, and you get a lot of moisture from it, and you can cool off in the heat, and in the summer you have a lot of fruit, and that's watermelon.\ncaller: Yes, I was in Seoul, and when I went to my grandmother's house in the countryside for the holidays, I really liked the eyes that were piled up on the mountains in the Sanjarak Mountains, and I would always wake up in the morning and go there with my cousins and my cousin's sisters and we would make a snowman and we would roll our eyes and we would build a snowman that was bigger than my body, and we would always make a snow man with twigs and a nose, and the next time we go to Russia or a country where there's a lot of cold snow, we would like to build a snow man that's several times bigger, and we'd like to see if you said that you like autumn, and if you're in Korea, do you have a place to go and have fun in the fall?\nreceiver: If you're looking for a great place to visit in the fall in Korea, I recommend the Great Chungju Lake, which is one of the largest lakes in Korea, and it's a nice place to drive, and when you climb to the top of the lake and look down, you get that feeling of relaxation and peace of mind.\ncaller: I've lived abroad in a country called the Philippines, which is divided into dry and rainy seasons, not four seasons, mostly in the summer when the weather is above 30 degrees Celsius, and living here in the hot weather for 365 days without four seasons makes me want to feel the cold even more when I come to Korea. I love feeling the cold weather in Korea, but have you ever been to Korea in winter?\nreceiver: When it comes to wintering in Korea, I'm usually cold in the winter and I don't like to go outside, but if you want to go there, I recommend a ski resort, because it snows a lot in Korea in the winter, but there are some places where it doesn't snow, and even if it does, there are places where it melts quickly, so if you'd like to see the sights, I recommend ski resorts, or a guest house, or something like that.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Who's going to be the pharmacist?\nHow long has your case been under investigation?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Let's say you don't open a bank account yourself.\nThat was your initial statement, right?\nreceiver: Yeah, they didn't.\ncaller: So you opened the National Bank account that was opened at the original location, did you not?\nYou've opened an account, haven't you?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: If you're in custody and you're being investigated, you might find something.\nThe rule of law doesn't mean that when you're the perfect suspect, we arrest you.\nIf you see enough dots, you'll be judged by all the documents and data.

How are you?\ncaller: Have you spoken to the prosecutor in charge of your case, Mr. 000?\nI want you to check it out, see if it's in there.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'd like to ask you a few questions, Mr. 000... do you have any relationship with the prosecutor?\nDid he sign a bail bond?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'll help you with your paperwork and I.D.\nDo you have a $1,000 note?\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: \"2023 Investigation No. 7403, the identity of the defendant, Mr. 000\" \"is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday, 01/02/2023, as a drug trafficker\".\nAs I make my transition, I will guard the Embassy with the utmost vigilance and ensure that the escape of evidence, the destruction of assets, the actions of Nick and others are not compromised.\nI have no responsibility whatsoever in regard to the illegal non-recourse loans that were executed on Friday's date, and I am not responsible for any money that was misappropriated.\nI promise to cooperate with you as and when the reimbursement is made by the Board of Trustees.\nIt's a national savings account, and I'm not going to use it.\nYou'll be severely punished.\ncaller: Do you have any identification?\nreceiver: There is.\ncaller: I've got my ID card in my hand, I'm holding it next to my face, and I'm recording a video, and I have to memorize this part and read it over and over and over.\nSend it to Hante Katok. Add him to Katok.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Mr. 000 just checked it out. Mr. 000 says that probation is a principle, and we're going to turn it into a drug, because we're not going to be able to do that for a long time.\nSince the attorney general's office has filed an I.D., Mr. 000 should have come to our financial controller.\nThere's a part where you have to fill out the paperwork and sign the criminal account trace papers.\nYou're claiming that there's no money in your bank account.\nYou're saying no.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Now, what we're gonna do is we're going to have to make sure that this case gets arrested.\nI'm going to visit the bank notes that Jan issued, and we're going to get the CCTV footage on that date.\nYou can check if it was issued late or through a bad employee.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, Mr. 000... we're receiving account-tracing civil documents for all accounts.\nWe're going to investigate whether there's any criminal proceeds from the sale of the doll.\nThe money is in the hands of the prosecutor, and the prosecution has the final say, and they have the authority to investigate.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: If Mr. 000 is a suspect, not a victim, then the prosecutor is a big deal.\nreceiver: Yes, I got it.\ncaller: Listen, Mr. 000 how do you identify yourself, the accused, the most important thing is to go to the legal\nWhat's important is identity, your identity, and why you shouldn't leak anything about the Embargo case.\nWhat is it?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: There's only one reason it can't be leaked, and that's because Mr. 000 is a suspect.\nIf you're the victim, can we leak this case or not?\nreceiver: No, you can't.\ncaller: You can't take legal action or anything because you're a victim.\nYou can't leak anything about the Embargo case because it's the identity of the suspect.\nI wonder what would have happened if you had told a family member about the Embargo case.\nIt's natural, and the people you're talking about will be punished as well.\nreceiver: Yes, I will.\n- Do not disclose to any third party.\n- The National Security Surveillance Account is being audited by you personally.\nThere's no way to avoid prosecution for failing to cooperate with pharmaceutical investigations.\ncaller: Can you make an appointment with me, Mr. 000?\nCan you promise me that?\nreceiver: Yes, I will.\ncaller: Listen to me, Mr. 000-- Mr. 000 probably has no criminal record, so he's got an I.D. that says he's a registered pharmacist.\nI think so, but it's the first time you've been turned into a pharmacist.\nI'm asking you how you're going to handle a case like this, where you have to pay back a loan that you took out illegally.\nBecause it's not personal property, it's going to be treated as public property.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you think about how you're going to do this, Mr. 000, you got a loan, you got it because you needed the money.\nDoes that mean that you pay off all of your loans by the due date?\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: So if you take out a loan on this date and you borrow $1,000,000 today, what would you do?\nWhat would the bank think if I told you that I paid you $1,000,000 in full?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If there's an employee checking your bank account, and there's a Kim Sang-ho working on the bank account.\nAnd of course, you'll think it's weird, because it's all exposed.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So what we're going to do with this part is we're just going to do it in partial reversals.\nI'm going to do it. 000 What are you going to do? 000 Where are the loans that you got from your bank right now?\nExcept for the million, what's your net worth? Give me an estimate.\nreceiver: Inventory of assets\ncaller: How many of your check cards do you use?\nreceiver: Two of them.\ncaller: This part isn't being worked on right now, it's going to be done by the prosecutor in charge of this case.\nAnd we're going to have our joint headquarters staff verify that you're available, and then I'm going to tell the inspector in charge\nIf a member of the joint venture's headquarters staff can be dispatched, they'll hand over the check card, and we'll make sure that you're on our side.\nWe're going to do some reimbursements like this day-to-day reimbursement, you know?\nYou can't use it until you've paid off your legal debt.\nreceiver: Is that you?\ncaller: Because it's unclear if 000 is the suspect or the victim.\nYou can't rely on us to transfer or smuggle assets.\nYou can't use it until it's finished, because it doesn't shrink.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: First, we'll need to confirm that our Joint Investigative Headquarters personnel are being deployed.\nWe have to check it, because it might have already been sent to the other side.\nI'll pass it on to the district attorney.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Instead, you're afraid to transfer your assets to a third-party lender because you won't see any of the damage.\nWe're going to return the $1,000,000 as of today, because there may be an accomplice in this financial transaction.\nIt's about time.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: You can get in touch with the reimbursed financial institution, because today's date is a partial reimbursement.\nSo you've reimbursed some of it, just answer it, and we'll treat it like you're reimbursing it.\nDo you understand?\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

How much can you deposit per month? 1,000,000 yuan?\nreceiver: No, it is 1,500,000 yuan.\ncaller: Yes. What if the interest is different in one year, in two years, in three years? Well, what's the base interest rate, what is the maximum interest rate, and what is the number of months with the most interest, and what are the percentages?\nreceiver: The base rate is 1.1% and the three-year rate is 2.7%.\ncaller: But when I went to the bank and looked it up, it said that the youth workers' allowance was 1.3 percent, and that's 2.7 percent, and I think it was over 3 percent, because I was wrong.\nreceiver: The special additional interest is only available for one-year products.\ncaller: So there's a one-year subscription, a special bonus, a salary bonus, an online bonus and a youth worker bonus, right?\ncaller: When you sign up for a one-year annuity, can you get all three at the same time, and that's 3.7%?\ncaller: A salary pool is a special type of salary pool that holds a salary transfer or salary transfer recognition standard in its own name through a Snowman bank account, but is it only recognized once a month?

How are you?\nreceiver: What can I do for you?\ncaller: I'd like to apply for a loan.\nreceiver: Yes, there are products that you can borrow for free.\ncaller: Is there a difference between the Darrin Faster Loan and the Darrin OneClick Loan?\ncaller: I've been thinking about those two products, and the faster loan is good because the final interest rate is lower than OneClick, but this one has a mid-term repayment fee, and OneClick has a slightly higher base rate.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is it correct to calculate the final interest rate at 0.8% of the base rate minus the coupon rate at 2.28% per annum?\ncaller: But these products don't have a premium, and they're frustrated that they don't get a discount.\nreceiver: Yeah, because it's a horror commodity.\ncaller: Are the interest rates on these products fixed or variable? There's also a mixed rate, which seems to be a mixture of fixed and variable.\nreceiver: It's a floating rate.\ncaller: So if the benchmark rate changes over the life of the loan, does that change my loan rate?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is there going to be a change in the benchmark, or is it going to be because the economy is not doing so well?\nreceiver: You don't know that.\ncaller: I love that there's a mid-term repayment fee, because you have to take out a loan secretly, so you have to pay it off as soon as you get the money.\ncaller: Suddenly, my best friend asked me to lend him some business capital, and soon the money was coming in, and if I didn't close the other card now, I would be broke, so he said to me to borrow the money urgently, that I would pay it back as soon as the money came in. I couldn't refuse to lend him the money because I was so desperate, so I needed an emergency.\ncaller: Can you subtract the interim repayment fee, which is the ratio of the interim reimbursement fee to the interest rate over the remaining life of the loan, and if the interest rate is 1.8 percent, it's way above the base rate.\ncaller: So it seems to me that one-click loans have a lower interest rate, assuming they pay off quickly, because there's a lot of loans out there, and it's hard for me to find the right one.\nreceiver: So let me introduce you to a quick loan with a similar interest rate and a faster loan with no interchange fees.\ncaller: If there's such a product, it's great, there's no mid-term repayment fee, and if it's a faster loan with the same interest rate, I'll definitely sign up for that product, but there will be conditions.\nreceiver: Yes, there's some paperwork you need to submit for that item.\ncaller: Yes, may I submit something?\nreceiver: Are you on duty?\ncaller: I've been with the company for about five years, I'm on maternity leave for about four years, I have four insurance policies, I pay taxes, and I'm getting paid about three million rupees a month.\nreceiver: If you are a salaried worker, you must provide proof of employment and proof of income issued by the Finnish Tax Agency.\ncaller: Is it possible to sign up for this as well? I don't have time to go to the bank, because there are no DDRIM branches near my company.\ncaller: And when I get home from work, the bank is closed, and if I'm not far from the bank, I tell my boss that I'm going to leave work a little bit early, because I'm in the next neighborhood, and I don't have a car, so I have to take public transportation, and then I have to leave work an hour early, because it's too conspicuous.\nreceiver: Yes, you can with an open door.\ncaller: And I'm very happy about that, and I'm a little worried because I've never taken out a loan online, but I think it's all right with the websites these days.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So I'm going to download some documents and apply for a loan online.\ncaller: Counsellor, do you have any deposits or collateral in the Dardim Bank?\nreceiver: Yes, there is.\ncaller: I have a savings account in a DDRIM bank, and there's about five million yuan in there, and can I borrow it as collateral? Because collateral loans have lower interest rates.\nreceiver: Please state your name and social security number.\nreceiver: Yes, the deposit account you signed up for is a collateralized account.\ncaller: How much of your down payment can you borrow? I think it would be a big help if you could borrow half of it, because I know that's a low interest rate.\nreceiver: It's within 100 percent of what you pay.\ncaller: So I'd like to get a loan with a deposit collateral instead of a quick loan product.\nreceiver: Yes, you can borrow it online, and you have to have a mobile phone certificate in your name.\ncaller: Yes, I will do that.\nreceiver: Do you have any more questions?\ncaller: I don't want him to know that I'm lending him money, because he doesn't like our friendship, and when we first got married, my mom made him take out a medical certificate, and it made him feel bad.\ncaller: But the first person to talk about it was my brother, and he had a really bad feeling about him, and he'd be really mad if he found out that you loaned him money.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: You don't know the groom? It's a big deal. I can't even imagine what happens when you fall for him.\nreceiver: Does your spouse have a valid ID of your client?\ncaller: It's stored on my home computer, but I don't really care about it, and I put it in a public computer at the beginning of the wedding, and I offered to put it in, but we don't care about each other, and I'm annoyed by the groom's personality, so I don' t think I need to check it with my certificate.\nreceiver: If you don't verify it with a valid certificate, your loan information will not be contacted separately by your spouse.\ncaller: Oh, I'm so glad. I'll have to erase the credentials at home. It's suspicious if I suddenly erase them, but I don't know because I'm not good with desktops.

Do you think it's possible to denuclearize North Korea?\ncaller: I don't think it's possible, Kim Jong-un, Chairman of the North Korean Commission, President, as a president, I feel comfortable saying that this denuclearization issue can't be solved by just getting rid of nuclear weapons, and I think that the situation in North Korea right now, or as president, as chairman of the Commission, is going to be very complicated.\nreceiver: Kim Jong Un's wife and sister, I've seen them in the newspapers, sometimes in interviews with North Korea's special representatives, and sometimes at summits with South Korea, and I've also seen them on the screen, and recently, when they're trying to talk to each other, they're having a joint meeting with South Korea. And North Korea says they're going to declare denuclearization, and they're sending letters to the U.S., and we're trying very hard to negotiate with them, and after the summit, we're talking to each other about what we want, and if it's possible to negotiate, we'll discuss economic support for North Korea, and what are the terms of further denuclearisation, and we'll talk to one another. I know that it's not easy to denuclearize because there's military pressure in North Korea, but I know that there's a lot of pressure in the United States right now, and I know that President Trump, who wants to make a lot of progress with North Korea, wants to make some progress, and I think that if North Korea makes a lot\ncaller: I think it's the role of the mediator, because Kim Jong-un has the 38th line, and we're the closest, and we have the most common language, and we can talk, and I think that's the best role for the mediator to play, and it seems like that's what we're doing right now.\nreceiver: I don't think North Korea wants war, I think they want economic help. If they want war, they will continue to develop nuclear weapons and launch missiles, but in the current situation, Chairman Kim Jong-un is asking for help from the United States or our country and wants to denuclearize. In this situation, I think we can go to the end of the declaration without a big reaction from North Korea, if we stop the training of the US-North Korean alliance, etc. I think the United States also wants the denuclearization of North Korea, followed by the declaration of an end to the peace of the Korean Peninsula, which is good for the peace of humanity in the world.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I like baseball and basketball, especially baseball. I've been watching baseball for over 30 years, and I'm a huge fan of baseball.\ncaller: Yeah, I've always loved to play ball since I was a kid, and I love football and basketball and baseball, and I also love baseball a lot, and now I'm doing it, but I love football even more, and baseball, well, it's hard to control, you know, because you have to have the net, and you have the ball, so baseball is just about watching, and you go to the ballpark a lot, usually, and now when you play with your friends, you play a lot of football, and I'm also a Lotto fan, and this year, I'm working really hard, so I'm watching almost every game.\nreceiver: Yeah, I watched you almost play baseball last year because Lotte was the runner-up, but I don't like it so much, I just didn't watch it because it was too late. So this year Lotte played a little bit, but he's a second baseman, and if he plays a little bit better, I think he'll be able to go to the playoffs, so yeah, I'm looking forward to it this year.\ncaller: I don't do it separately, I like to watch sports and stuff like that, because these days, but because of the corona, I don' t have anything to do with watching this on TV, so these days I only watch baseball, and I' m usually looking for matches, not just the Premier League, Tottenham, but also the Korean basketball player, Keviel, who is almost a fan of Katie, so I watch almost every game, so when the Olympics are held, and I almost watch the Olympics, I think I like that sport at least if there is a favorite athlete or something like that\nreceiver: My favorite sport is basketball, but I don't know if I can pick just one of my favorite sports right now, so I like a team called Lotte, but I'm a big fan of some of the players there, and I'm not that big of a fan, I just like the Lotte team, and if I could pick just a few of my favorite players on that team, you know, the pitcher's side, he's a little bit of a kick-off pitcher, and on the other side, it's probably the most touchy-feely thing, and I just like to watch the circle, so maybe you're one of my other favorite athletes.\ncaller: Yeah, I'm not exactly cheering for anyone or anything, but I'm on my cheerleading squad, and I'm also a lot of people in the lottery, so I've been cheering for Kim Jong-un players since I was a freshman. I've always cheered for him. He's been a fan of my school since he was a rookie. I'm always cheering for him.\nreceiver: So, if there's one athlete out there that you like, is there another one that you don't like?\ncaller: I used to have a lot of haters, but now when you look at baseball, you'll see that the opposing team is made up of a bunch of jerks, and then all of a sudden, I'm going to talk about the player I don't like to make jokes with, and then suddenly, the player I dislike to be made up of jokers, and it's kind of weird that when a made-up player throws a ball, it always gives me the feeling that the referees are so good at catching strikes, and they're just going to use that stuff, and the ball is really slow, and so it's not that he's not a hater, but when he's playing baseball, he makes jokes, and he doesn't make jokes.\nreceiver: I don't like to see a lot of good players in the Lotte team, because I watch a lot of baseball, and now I see that the good players don't hate it anymore, but this is definitely a game that Lotte can win because of those two players, and there are a lot of games that Lotte loses, especially now that there are many cases like the name player, which is being talked about a lot these days. This really gave the name player a lot of opportunities for three years, but he has no talent in baseball, and because he continues to use it, the other second-team players hardly get that chance.\ncaller: Yeah, you mentioned the name player, and I hate it. I didn't realize it, but if you watch a lot of Lotto games, there's always a lot of chances in front of that name player, even though he's hitting after the touchdown, but every time there's a chance, he looks like he's not himself, he doesn't throw the ball, but he's always hitting a three-pointer or a ground ball, somehow, so I think I'm also not talented.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm kind of on that side too, so I was looking at the second team, and the Kim Min-soo player looked really good when I saw him, and there were a lot of other good players in the second team because he didn't give the other players a chance, so he kind of responded and said, \"Oh, it's good that Lotte is a player, but it's also good that the manager is a little bit too stubborn, and it's like, oh, I see that, so it's definitely Lotte has now heard about the fifth round, they've heard about the 5th round, and they've won the championship almost once in 92 years, and they have won it almost once in 30 years, or they haven't won it for almost 30 years, so I think it would be good if they won it again, because Lotte is using more players now, or there's more talk about that.\ncaller: I'd also like to see Lotte win something, but I don't know if that Idaho player is old enough, but if I do know that it's time to retire, I'd like to see an Idaho player go to the Korean Series before he plays in action, even if he doesn't win a game.\nreceiver: The Idaho players are now in their 80s, and the Idaho players, as far as I'm concerned, have a very slow artificial foot, but they're very good at hitting, and not just home runs, but they also have a very good contact, so I think the Idaho player, even at 40 years old, is a player who can do a basic three-pointer.\ncaller: Recently, I've been watching a match where I've won five in a row, and then I've lost again, and I don't really watch the game anymore, but I'm interested in watching it again when I'm playing against Katie and who she is, Katie and Hannah, but I have been watching it again recently, and there's a Kim Jae-young player on the second team, and he looks like he's very talented with his striking form or something like that, but then I see him again, and his name comes up again, and then he says, \"Well, these days, when I watch the game again, I look like I'm very knowledgeable, like the coach said before, and I feel like I get caught up in the media or something like this, so I'd like to see him get stronger and stronger, and I would like to talk about him, but I think he's not really talented\".\nreceiver: Yeah, so the name player is now seeing that he's been guaranteed three years in a row, so now he's guaranteed another chance for more than three years, and now that he can't play baseball, he's wondering if he's going to lose a little bit of opportunity.\ncaller: I'm just wondering if this is the year that pro baseball is going to go to a no-hitter, which I'm kind of curious about, because I like to go to the ballpark and cheer, and at first, you know, after a certain amount of time, the crowd comes in, but this year it's going to be like this.\nreceiver: Usually, it's a man-made coronavirus, so it's going to go away, and then the crowds are going to come back to Seoul because of that, and then it's coming back again and again, and now it's in the country, and you have to continue to wear masks, and I'm doing this, and when I watch it, I don't know how long this is going to be so unpopular this year, and baseball is almost over, and the fan race is going on until November, so when I see it again, it'll be cold again in the fall, and I think the coronavirus will get worse, and I do not know, but I think if the coronavirus goes quiet for a month in July or August, it will get a small audience, and if it continues to spread, and it's not cured, then I think this could go on for the rest of the season, and I say yes, so I'd like to see the coronavirus go away quickly.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

The excessive monthly tax burden is a huge burden on the taxpayers. Moreover, it's a great catastrophe that these days, during the Corona crisis, when consumption has decreased, the shops are still receiving their monthly taxes.

I think it's not easy to revise because of the complexity of the relationship between the building owners and the political authorities.

What's your relationship with Mr. Gangdong, Mr. Han Tae Hyun, Mr. Hantasu?\nreceiver: I don't know who.\ncaller: Don't you know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And we asked why, because our special investigative team, as of Friday last week, has now investigated eight financial crimes.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And in the process, we've confiscated a large number of cash registers, and now credit cards, including accounts at the People's Bank of China, which are now in Mr. Kim's name.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So you don't know anything about the National Bank and now the opening of the Agricultural Cooperation account.\nreceiver: The National Bank canceled that because they don't use it.\ncaller: So we checked the bank accounts, and it turns out that on March 5th, 2015, two banks in the Seoul area had just opened.\nreceiver: Are you in Seoul?\ncaller: I just got confirmation that it's opening in Seoul, so I'm calling you now on behalf of Kim Jin himself.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: This container is now in the hands of criminals, it's been used as a storage tank for about a week, and about 60 million won of illicit funds have been stolen.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Kim Jin is not the only one, there are about 80 people involved, some of whom are now bankers, some of them are now cardholders, but now some of them have gotten into financial difficulties and have sold money orders, and there are a lot of people who are now suffering from identity theft.\nreceiver: So what do we do?\ncaller: So you're the suspect in this case who, from the perspective of our police department, is now being paid to sell warrants?\nreceiver: What about me?\ncaller: Yes, as I said at the beginning, there's been an indictment.\nreceiver: I've never heard of this.\ncaller: You filed a complaint, you were defrauded, you put money into an account in Kim Jin's name, the fraudster stole the money, and now you know the accomplice, so you file a complaint.\nreceiver: Then who stole it last year?\ncaller: So now we're calling to clarify that.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So first of all, to determine whether we were directly involved in this incident or were victims of a leak,\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: We're going to do a preliminary examination of the call recording.\nreceiver: So I have to go to Seoul?\ncaller: I'm going to do a preliminary examination on the recording, and then I'll send you a subpoena.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So now we're going to record all the calls and use them as evidence.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I'm going to ask you a question, and I'm not going to give you a simple example, but I want you to be honest with me.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Let's start the recording investigation now. This is a one-on-one phone recording investigation of the 0130 hijacking case. I am Assistant Sergeant Jun of the Seoul Police Department's Economic Crimes Special Investigation Team.

What's that sound?\ncaller: Now we've got a complaint, and we're looking at the data, and if you're just a little bit stronger, you can go about your normal business as a victim, and now you're saying that you're dealing with two banks.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: You said you're doing business with the Post Office and the Agricultural Society, and you know how much money you have left, and you're good with your money, and that's normal.\nreceiver: Uh, because I want to buy something with my parents and my parents.\ncaller: There's some in the two basins, some in the post office.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm farming with my parents right now.\ncaller: So how many of you use a credit or debit card?\nreceiver: There's no such thing as a credit card with your parents.\ncaller: So where's the credit card now that you're trading?\nreceiver: It's fresh and modern.\ncaller: It's fresh and modern. Just a minute.\nreceiver: How are you?\ncaller: Yeah, so you're a newbie and you're using the modern cash card service now?\nreceiver: What's the cash service like?\ncaller: So now that you've applied, there's something you can take out and spend.\nreceiver: I didn't.\ncaller: You didn't?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So you're saying that now that you've been certified, now that your personal property funds, now that the bank bonds, now that you only have $10 million?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If we send you a summons later, you'll have to come now.\nreceiver: The subpoena's coming in a couple of days?\ncaller: We'll have you out of here within the next week.\nreceiver: I'm not old enough for this.\ncaller: Well, I'm going to let you go for 48 hours, and you're going to be free to come and be examined.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yes, well, if you send a summons, you can now set aside 28 hours for the date of the summons and 50 minutes to prepare.\nreceiver: What do I have to prepare for?\ncaller: Please bring your identification.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: You'll be on the first floor, you'll go to the Citizen's Center, and you'll hand in your ID, and then you'll come up to the Economic Crimes Unit on the third floor.\nreceiver: Where are you located, near the bus terminal?\ncaller: It's on the right-hand side of the road, so it's gonna take a while, so you're gonna have to take a bus.\nreceiver: I'll tell you what I'll do.\ncaller: I'm the one who addresses them, and they're all journalists anyway.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yes, please.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

I have a little fantasy and a lot of curiosity about my job as a flight attendant, and I'm sure I'll continue to ask questions like that, so I'd like to know how long it was.\nreceiver: The first thing I did to prepare the crew was I worked in a hotel for a year, and now I'm kind of used to the hotel, and I wanted to try something new, so I think it took me about six months in total to prepare, because I was working in a hotel, and then I was interviewing, and I had an interview about a month ago, and the other crew members were interviewing each other in the same studio as a role-playing game, and I was the interviewer, and the opposing hospital was the other person who came to the interview, and they were giving each other feedback, so it took about six months to prepare on their own, and you were preparing with other candidates, and that's how long it took.\ncaller: Well, I went to a specialized high school, and after I graduated from high school, I did some internships, and at the time, I had a second-class computer skills certification, and I had some accounting management, or accounting and accounting, or something like that, but there was a little bit of a lack of preparation for the certification, so I got an additional first class computer skills, and then another second class accounting, and I think that the degree in accounting was the most important thing, and the career in the related job is the most important part.\nreceiver: The hard part of working abroad was that it was a little bit overwhelming to live abroad, and there were probably Koreans around, but living in Korea is a little bit different, especially in Qatar, which is a country that's a little bit closed off from the outside world, and there's also a little bit of a class society there, and there are a few people who don't like foreign workers like me a little bit, and the food itself is very expensive in that country, and when you go abroad, you have to spend a little bit more money, so I don't really know how to cook, but I'm trying to save some money, so naturally my cooking skills have improved a little bit.\ncaller: Yeah, I worked a schedule when I was working at that department store, and it wasn't so much that the schedule was hard, it was that I was obsessed with a little bit of work, or that I was a little bit unsuccessful in the role of being able to separate myself from the little bit, so now I'm checking my e-mails all the time on my days off, and if there's a chat or a chat, I think it's because of that anxiety that I've made a mistake, and I think that's why it was such a little problem that I didn't get separated, and I don't feel like I was resting, and I was so uncomfortable that I had to keep shaking with anxiety, and then I thought, if I keep doing this, I'm going to lose my job first, and it's too hard for me because I feel like it's going to be so hard for me, and I have to shred this thing, and I've got to fix it, and I remember thinking about it as much as I can, so I keep checking my work every day off, and\nreceiver: When I was in elementary school, my teacher told me that I went to high school a couple of times, and I moved around a lot, so when I get along with my friends a little bit, I break up with them again, and then I go to school, and I get on with other kids, and I move around again, and this kind of thing happens a little bit more often, so it's a little hard to get along with your friends. Anyway, when you get along with him again, you feel like you're never going to see him again, and you have to make new friends at the new school, and you're like this because of the pressure, and you know, in the last elementary school I went to, my personality changes a little bit. So when I was in primary school, my mother and I, who was the head teacher at the time, talked a little bit about it, and we found out that name1 is a little bit difficult in this regard, and we realized that if you come to me first, you don't have to be so upset about it, but you also don't need to be too upset because your friends broke up with you, and you\ncaller: Well, I've been a bit of an extrovert since I was a kid, and then I've become a little bit of an introvert as I've gotten really old, so I'm wondering if maybe this test, this test called ambitia, is a little bit more introverted than extroverted.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

classify: <conversation>\ncaller: I was wondering if you had a favorite season.\nreceiver: Well, I like autumn best because it's not too hot or too cold, and looking up at the sky can pierce my heart.\ncaller: I love winter, it's a little bit of winter, I like the cold, it gets a little bit chilly, it shivers, it shakes, it is a little bit refreshing, and I like that, and I have my favorite Christmas in winter, and I can't wait until a month before Christmas, and I get mad, so when I see winter, I think of Christmas, and the weather is my favorite weather, so I like winter, and then there are seasons that I don't like.\nreceiver: Well, I hate the summer because in the summer I like to be active, and even a little bit of active archery can make you sweat more easily and make you feel hotter, so that's kind of hard to do.\ncaller: I hate summer, too, because I sweat so much, and I walk so little, and it's hard, and I'm tired, and I don't feel like doing anything, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable, and I get a little annoying around people, but it's my birthday in the summer, and I can't hate it that much.\nreceiver: Usually when you're born in the summer, you're strong for the season, but then you're weak for the heat.\ncaller: It's just that I've changed a little bit in my body, and I was young, and I didn't even know it was hot until I was in high school, and I barely even sweated, and it was hot, and I just, um, it was a little hot today, and I did this, and at some point, I got too weak from the heat, and it's like I'm a little bit different.\nreceiver: But I think that's better, because I was born in the spring, and I don't have a summer body, nor a winter body, and I think I've come to love autumn, because it's so easy to ride in the heat and so easy to get burned in the cold.\ncaller: Well, I do, but spring and autumn, the weather itself is so good, but it's hard because I have hay fever and allergies, and it's not that I'm hard because I don't like a little bit of spring and fall, it's just a hard season.\nreceiver: It's gonna be hard to keep a pet in the house if you have a wart.\ncaller: That's usually true, but I'm raising a cat.\nreceiver: Do you mind if I ask what kind of cat you have, what kind, what name, anything?\ncaller: It's Korean Cheese, and her name is Yoon Ochi.\nreceiver: You can ask him how he got his name and how long he lived with you.\ncaller: I've been living with her for a year now, and the way I met her is that she's walking down the street like this, and she's hearing something like a baby crying, so I'm making a lot of noise, and I went with my boyfriend next to her, and we saw that she had a cat, a real baby cat, so I couldn't leave her, and like I said before, it's rainy in the spring and autumn, but I left everything, and she was so cute, and sadly, she's so beautiful, and I brought her home, so we're living together for a year.\nreceiver: You know, it's not easy to get a big cat to live with you, but you're great, and I don't have a beard, but I'm still raising puppies in the old days.\ncaller: Usually, the older you get, the cuter you get.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, I guess that's what people do, and as I get older, I feel like I've spent a lot of time with him, so I can think of him as family, and, uh, I'm really grateful for all the years I've had.\ncaller: Well, we were talking about our favorite seasons, and I think that's why animals have a hard time with all the seasons, so my ducks are either too hot in the summer to be near the air conditioning or they're too long in the winter to be in the bushes, and maybe even a puppy.\nreceiver: And in the case of dogs, they don't sweat because they have no sweat holes, unlike humans, and they're covered in hair, so they only have to sweat with their tongue, and they drool a lot, and they have a lot of trouble with their babies, so I think it's the same with cats.\ncaller: I live with a cat, so it's not easy to take the cat outside, so in the summer I want to go to the beach with the cat, or even go on vacation, but I can't, and in the winter when it snows, I want to take him to see the sights, but I think it's nice that the dog can still be taken out like that.\nreceiver: Yes, it's great to be able to walk and play and exercise with him, but on the other hand, in the case of a walker, he's too big, and he's a puppy from the backyard, so he's sleeping at home with you or spending the weekend with you, and I'm a little jealous that your cat can't do that.\ncaller: I told you that my favorite season is autumn, and then in the fall, where do I go, what do I think about, where should I go on a trip, there's a place I set up like this, because every summer I go to Busan, just for my birthday, like that, maybe it's autumn or some other season.\nreceiver: I want to go to the mountains and see the wind blowing, or when I see the red-stained leaves on the sidewalk, I can feel that time has passed again this year, and when I look at the sky, my heart can be so relaxed, but there is no fixed location, I just want to go out with my girlfriend in the fine wind every autumn\ncaller: Is there somewhere else you want to go with your girlfriend?\nreceiver: I want to go to the beach with my girlfriend, summer or winter or whatever the weather is, the sea is always there and wide and nice because the sea is nice in summer, but in winter when you walk across the sea, because of the cold weather, you can be close to each other and share the heat, so it's easier to catch the sun, I want to spend time with my girlfriend like that.\ncaller: Well, I'm with my boyfriend, and of course I love to travel so much that I want to go to the sea or the mountains, but I haven't really been abroad yet, so I'd like to go abroad with my boyfriend because there's no specific country or anything like that, but I just want to start from the beginning with where I'm going with my boyfriend and we'll all go together in my favorite winter.\nreceiver: I've never been abroad with a girlfriend, but like you said, it's nice to have those memories, and I'd love to go if I could.\ncaller: I've never been abroad, but maybe I've been abroad.\nreceiver: I've traveled abroad in the past when I was a kid, and it was with my family, and I wanted to go abroad for a vacation or a vacation rather than visiting a place like that.\ncaller: You know, sometimes I see people who like it when it rains and people who love it when it snows.\nreceiver: I live in a place where snow doesn't come easily, so I like it a lot, especially since I have a dog, so we can go out and jump together, and I like to look at the eyes, but I don't like it when it rains, because it's humid and it's chasing, and I don' t like it very much.\ncaller: I've always hated the summer, and maybe the main reason I hate it is because of the humidity and the rain that comes in the summer, because of the dampness, and the snow is actually really nice when it comes, and it's nice to see the snow falling, but I don't like all the snow and walking on the slippery floor, or moving around a little bit, so I guess I really don't really like the rain or the snow.\nreceiver: Well, you said you hated the summer, but if you could replace the heat with air conditioning or electricity or something, then you'd be okay in the summer.\ncaller: Of course, it's nice inside, but there's something about the summer itself that gives me a little bit of something, and I don't like it, and I have this feeling that even if I turn on the air conditioning, the summer itself comes, and I'm a little bit, oh, another summer, and it's a summer that I hate, a little bit stressed about this already, even with the air conditioner turned off, I hate summer just as much, and I love winter because I forget about it in the winter, and I like it so much, in that warm front porch, watching movies or dramas or just videos on my phone or something like that.\nreceiver: I'm sympathetic to that hobby, but I like or hate certain seasons, and there's no such thing, but when I heard about you, I only like winter during the monsoon season, and I don't like the rest of the seasons.\ncaller: I'm gonna make sure that you're happy all four seasons, and now that we're in the middle of a summer that neither one of us likes very much, I'd like you to think about it and have a great summer.\nreceiver: Yes, it's not a long summer, but on the positive side, we have holidays, and we have a rainy season that we don't like, but when we see the rain falling inside the house, we can relax and relax, and if we spend time doing other leisure activities, that's not bad either.\ncaller: That's right.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the

Have you ever had a hard time because of your personality?\nreceiver: When I was in high school, I was really nice to my best friends, but I had a tendency to show off to my weirdest friends, and I think that's why, in the old days, my best friends didn't want to get close to me, because they knew who I was, and they wanted to be close to me a lot, and the kids that I was seeing for the first time, they didn't seem to want to be close, so I guess it was hard.\ncaller: I had a hard time with that in middle school, and then over time, when I was in high school, I tended to just play around, but there was a group of kids that I was kind of friendly with, and I think I was a little bit friendly with all the kids.\nreceiver: I heard that you moved to Jisoo Road, so where did you live before Jisoo came?\ncaller: I've moved around a lot, and I was born in Kimpo, and I've been to Gangwon Road, and I came back to Seoul, and I went to Seoul, then I went to Kimpo, then I studied in the Philippines, and then I went on to Pyeongchang, then I came to Jeju Road, and that's how I've lived in Jeju for eight years now.\nreceiver: Yeah, I mean, I've lived in Jersey since I was a kid, and I don't think I've been out there much.\ncaller: So you don't have any plans for a job in another country or anything like that?\nreceiver: I don't have any idea at the moment, but I'll think about it a little bit later, because I'm not really sure what's going on in Jersey City right now.\ncaller: I don't remember exactly when I was a kid, but when I was growing up in Seoul, the kids tended to make friends very quickly, and my father was a soldier, and he lived in a soldier's apartment with his sons and daughters, and he had friends who were soldiers, and we just played a lot in the neighborhood.\nreceiver: You've lived in Jersey City for eight years, and I've been in Jersey for eight years so I wonder what it's like in Jersey City.\ncaller: I think I'm the best player in the world because I'm a kid, and I move around a lot, and I don't have a little girl friend, and I'm eight years old, and I still keep in touch with my high school friends, so that's great, but did you know that you said that your personality is sometimes polygamous, and that polygamy was a bad experience for you? Well, I'm not normally a big polygamist, but when I'm exercising, I tend to get a little bit more aggressive, like when we're playing against a giant in high school, or when we lose, and if the opponent plays a little bit less aggressive, I just go and get angry, and I think I had a lot of fights, so I suffered a little bit from polygamy, and when I went to high school, there was this sort of thing called polygamy.\nreceiver: When I was in high school, as I said before, the kids hated me because I was always trying to show off, and I think one of the things that changed me a lot was that one of my friends around me started yelling at me a lot, and I started getting more friends in high school and then I bought a sweater in high school or middle school, and then my personality changed a lot.\ncaller: I think I've gone from being a very active kid in high school to going to college and meeting a lot of people and going back and forth and becoming more and more shy and having low self-esteem and hating myself so much that I'm trying so hard to get over it.\nreceiver: I don't think that I have a very high self-esteem, because it seems to me that people around me are always superior to me, and I feel that way all the time, and I really don't even think that I've got a very high ego, I think it's a little bit too high, but when was the time that I didn't like myself the most?\ncaller: I'm a bit of a character, and I don't like it when I can't say exactly what I want to say.\nreceiver: When I was in high school, I lost money in class, and I was running around looking for money, and I pushed a friend in front of me, and I got angry and said a lot of things to that friend, and he was a really nice friend, and I think about it now, and I don't like my personality so much, and I have a lot of regrets, but I think it's a good thing that my personality has changed a little bit now that I'm in high school.\ncaller: That's it.\nreceiver: I wonder how much your personality has changed compared to when you were in elementary school and high school.\ncaller: In elementary school, I was a very solitary child, and in high school, I had a lot of active, lively, active activities, and a lot of outdoor activities, and there were a lot of actors performing in front of people, and my personality changed without hesitation, and I wondered if there was a difference in the way I treated my friends, who were comfortable, or who were a little uncomfortable.\nreceiver: When I'm with a close friend, I'm not embarrassed to say nothing, but when I'm around a stranger, I keep silent and shy, so I don't say much, and I keep being awkward, and I never want to be alone with a stranger.\ncaller: Oh, I think there are times when I hate that awkward silence so much that I tend to talk more, and when I'm in a close relationship, I tend to be more quiet, and when it's between friends, I like to listen to friends talking more, and I have that character.\nreceiver: And then, when you're playing with your friends, do you like to be in the center of your friends, or do you prefer not to be?\ncaller: It depends on how many friends you have, how many daughters you have, so on the other hand, when you have two people, you tend to talk a little bit more, when it's just me and a friend and two people, if it's a jump style, when there's a bunch of people, if you're behind a small footprint, you have a tendency to look a little bit backwards.\nreceiver: When I'm with two people, I talk a lot, and if it's a jumping style, there's a lot of kids around, but if there are ten people, I don't walk in front of the fence, I just walk in the back and talk to one or two people.

If you go through a lot of the negative distribution process, it is always a little bit more difficult to survive, and we have to give money and eat everything, and those parts are always complaining, but cut that part down. So how can we buy the price of the fish so that the consumer can eat a little bit cheaper, instead of cutting that part down a little bit?\ncaller: But there's a lot of distribution in the middle and there's no money to accumulate, and it's all written in this article, but if I work in a lottery store, I have to buy or send clothes directly to the lottery store and then I have to do a lot of advertising, but I mean, I have a partnership with lottery stores, and they have a lot of ads there that the clothes made in the form of bags are sold for direct delivery only to be sold in lottery store.\nreceiver: No, that's the part where the fish is picked up by the right people, so it's picked up cheaply, or the farmer and the consumer eliminate all the intermediate margins and sell them on the Internet if necessary, but I think that's okay too, but the reason for the split is that the fish is not coming out of the human capital, but it's not easy to pick up the fish yourself, but the Internet is good these days, so it seems that it's okay to pick up that because you do not want people around you to pick up anything, but you do it, and the farmers and the consumers can do this together.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Can I help you?\ncaller: Hi, I'm using a Sharing card. Yesterday was the due date, but I didn't get my card due, so I called to ask if I could have a consultation.\nreceiver: Please state your name and credit card number for accurate consultation.\ncaller: The card number is 1234 5678 1234 5678.\ncaller: I got a text message saying that there was a delay in my payment and I had to pay a penalty for late payment, but it's only for one day, and the amount is small, so I can use the card, and even if it's small, if the delay is long, I can get a penalty, the card can be suspended, etc. The penalty was deposited this morning.\ncaller: So you're saying that if you're in arrears or you have bad credit, you're going to visit a credit card office or a company that's looking into your bonds, and they'll either suspend your credit card depending on your credit rating, or they'll notify the credit reporting agency depending on the arrears, and then they'll share your arrears with the other financial institutions, and so on.\ncaller: Depending on the circumstances, it's a legal process under the Civil Procedure Act and the Civil Enforcement Act, which involves seizures, foreclosures, repossessions, car auctions, etc., to recover your credit card debt, and even after you've repaid all of your arrears, your annuity records, etc., are preserved for a certain amount of time over a financial period.\ncaller: You're saying that if the amount of your A-card arrears exceeds $5,000,000, even if you pay off all the arrears, the arrears and cancellation records will be stored for a maximum of one year for the length of the arrears. In this case, you may be disadvantaged in financial institution transactions.\ncaller: For example, you could have your credit cards suspended, or your credit card limits reduced, or in the worst case scenario, your credit card could be suspended.\ncaller: Well, there's no hard and fast rule, but every financial institution has its own set of guidelines for disadvantages.\ncaller: For example, if you're in a credit-grant transaction and you're trying to get a new card issuance or a credit-deposit guarantee loan, you might get a lower loan amount than normal, you might be limited to issuing new cards, you might not be able to issue guarantees, and your credit history is being used to limit or discriminate against your credit score.\ncaller: If you're wondering, if I'm late with a payment on another person's card, can I suspend the use of a shared card that I paid normally and didn't pay late, because if you're in a hurry, there's probably a debit card on one of the cards that you're using, and you might forget and not be able to pay off the card, so you might have to use the card if you are in a rush.\ncaller: The availability of a credit card is a matter of agreement between the cardholder and the member.\ncaller: The standard credit card membership policy states that if a member is found to be unsuitable for membership due to a delay or a change in the credit status of another member, the card issuer may suspend the membership or suspend the use of the card and notify you of the reason.\ncaller: Now, if your credit card balance is over $100,000 and you're more than five days late on a business day, the information about the delay is being shared between financial institutions, so depending on the financial institution's judgment, someone else's credit card may be suspended, and a shared card company may also be suspended if another card is delayed.\ncaller: We're also issuing and using family cards, and I'm wondering if, when the family card expires, the person registered as a family will still have a record of the card connection in the future, because if you do that, you can't even have a family connection record.\ncaller: Because the family card is synchronized with your personal card and can be used within your limitations, the family card history is also shown only in your personal history, and there is no history for your family.\ncaller: So you're saying that your family's credit card usage is recorded only in your personal history, and that your family is solely responsible for the use and management of your credit card.\ncaller: So you're saying that when a credit card becomes a cooperative, it doesn't earn any points, and that's too much of a regulation, because it's not just a regulation that applies to the card-sharing companies, but it applies to them under a common standard agreement to prevent disputes between the cardholder and the customer, so it's based on the common standard agreement that most card companies operate that way.\ncaller: If your credit card balance is $50,000 or more, if you have a credit card balance and you want to unlock the balance, you have to go through a re-evaluation process, and then the credit card reviewer will go through a new set of procedures, such as income or credit rating, and the balance will be unlocked.\ncaller: Sometimes you can use a card to use a credit card, and it's not just the use of a credit card that makes your credit score go down, but it's the overuse of a card that can have a negative impact on your credit score, and it can lower your credit limit.\ncaller: It means that you can't make a withdrawal from the card company by linking your card, you can only do it after you've sent them a card with the reason for the withdrawal, the amount, and the date of the withdraw, and then you can send them a text message.\ncaller: So if you have a credit card or a credit card transaction that's done correctly and without delay, that has a positive effect on your credit rating, it doesn't mean that just because you don't have any credit card transactions, your credit rating is going to be better, but you have to try to do the right credit card transactions that match your income.\ncaller: I think you have to be careful that the cards don't get burned. I thought it was okay to burn the cards for a while, but it wasn't. I'm going to have to be very careful with the cards in the future.\ncaller: It's the first time I've done this, and I was worried that the card would be suspended and unusable, which it wasn't, thankfully, but I'm going to make sure that next time I don't delay a single day.\ncaller: Thank you so much for your kind response, I had a lot of questions and it was very helpful.\nreceiver: Do you have any other questions?\ncaller: It doesn't.\nreceiver: Thank you.

It's the first time I've been there in nine years, and it's changed a lot, but it's not so good right now, so I haven't had a lot of people gathered, but I've gone to all kinds of places and taken a lot of pictures and eaten a lot and tasted a lot of food.\nreceiver: Most recently, I was in Taipei with one of my friends, and I was so bored, I wanted to go to the ocean, and there were so many people there, despite the coronavirus, that I felt a little bit bored, but it was nice to be able to eat and drink from the ocean for the first time in a long time.\ncaller: I also went to Taipei in April, but it was very expensive, so I asked everyone to come, and they said it was too expensive, and I thought a lot about where I should go and eat, but in the end, wherever I went, the prices were the same, and I ate like that the next morning, but I still wanted to have a delicious meal, but before I came back, there was a mammoth in Taipei for lunch, and I remember eating it and going back to Taiwan.\nreceiver: I've been there before, but I haven't been there lately, and I think it's a little bit vague to say this, because I've actually been to a lot of places in the province, not the biggest cities, but domestic destinations, and when I went there, there were a lot of dead businesses and a lot of empty buildings, so I was a little bit upset.\ncaller: I have a friend who works in the military camp, and he's been asking me to come and eat for two or three years now, but I can't because I don't have to go to the military camp to eat it.\nreceiver: I think it's hard to be a little light-hearted, because there's a lot of dead and dying around here, and I don't really have anything to recommend, but frankly, I'm sorry, there's not much.\ncaller: So, if you're not in the trenches, where are your real memories?\nreceiver: I've traveled domestically, but I've also traveled internationally, and I really love flying, and probably the most memorable thing is not my family, but my first personal trip to Tokyo, Japan.\ncaller: Yes, I've been to Japan four times with my family, and the only place I could go was Fukuoka, and I really wanted to go to Osaka or Tokyo, but I couldn't because the price difference between Fukuoka and Tokyo was too much. I remember Tokyo, but it's definitely more expensive than Tokyo, because it's the capital of Japan.\nreceiver: Before I went to Japan for the first time, I had heard a lot about the cost of living in Japan, but when I got there, it was obvious that transportation was 15 times more expensive than in my country, and the restaurants and stuff were honestly similar.\ncaller: So, Japanese food is a little bit of everything.\nreceiver: When I first ate it, I thought that if I put a spoonful of salt in Korean food, it would taste just like that, so I felt it was very spicy, and it's not too spicy for the human taste, so I tasted it.\ncaller: So you're telling me that it was a fluke?\nreceiver: I had a good time with it.\ncaller: Japanese food is so delicious that I didn't really understand what real people were saying about it. I had just traveled to Japan, and I don't like it. It doesn't taste good, because I'm a bit of a tongue twister or something, but when I went to Japan, I really wanted to go to convenience stores and eat Korean food, and it was so hard to go to places where it tasted so delicious, and I wanted to eat it at home because it tasted too spicy, and it didn't taste so good, and we don't have this kind of underpants in our country.\nreceiver: Yes, what you just said is definitely the streets or uh people are now ordered in this way definitely Japan is a little more advanced nationalism I definitely felt and I felt\ncaller: So, have you ever been anywhere else in the world other than Japan?\nreceiver: I've been to Japan, other countries, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, and three other places.\ncaller: A friend of mine has been studying in China since middle school, and he's now using his Chinese to do a little bit of work and a lot of extra-curricular work, and then I realized that this friend really wants to go to China and see the real China, so let's go with all my friends.\nreceiver: I would recommend that you go to Shanghai for a trip to China, and once you're there, you'll feel a little bit more open, and you'll see that Shanghai is an international city, and there are a lot of foreigners, and there's a lot of Chinese locals, and you can meet a lot of different people, and now for the food, I'd like to recommend my favorite Chinese food.\ncaller: And the thing that I was most curious about was, well, is it still, rather than that, is it not that, you know, these people walking around naked on the streets of China, you see them on the news or on TV or whatever, and they're really, really, really walking around naked in their neighborhoods?\nreceiver: You're talking about the prize money?\ncaller: I'm not familiar with the area.\nreceiver: I saw it.\ncaller: It's for your prize.\nreceiver: There's a lot of people who don't vote for the prize, and there are a lot of guys who are hot and sweaty, but the damage is relatively minor, because the cities are bigger and more developed.\ncaller: I've only been abroad to those two countries, and that's what I've been to Japan and Vietnam, and that was a friendly trip with a friend, and now I'm in Vietnam for three or four days, and I feel like I'm a king, because I've heard that this is the economy in Korea and Vietnam, that's one-twentieth of the economy, and so I went and I exchanged 800,000 yuan, and I spent a lot of money, and then and now our football coach in Korea, the banking director, is also very popular there, so I thought we should thank him, and on the contrary, he's a good Korean buyer, and there's a culture where you get tips from Koreans, and my friend and I go to Da Nang and meet so many real local guides who ask for tips, but they're so kind, and I couldn't give them to you because I was really confused by the amount of money I had at the time, and I wondered if you'd ever been to Vietnam.\nreceiver: Yeah, I've been to Vietnam once, and I've seen it, and like you just said, I got really rich, I felt like a prince, and I felt it, and I sympathized with it, so I swapped a little bit of money, and I got a lot of cash, and it was cheap, so I thought, well, let's take more, and we'll definitely enjoy it. So I booked a resort, and I had a really good massage parlor, and after I got the tip you just mentioned, I just gave it to him, and then I came back later, because the airport is a taxicab, and I only had a few coins left, so it was a little bit crazy, but it was definitely a good experience.\ncaller: And the first time I went to Vietnam, I didn't feel very friendly.\nreceiver: Yes, I felt a lot, I just spoke in Korean, I just said it in Korean, and I just came here, and I was in front of you, and I showed you the way, and I had people like that, and I gave them tips, too.\ncaller: I didn't get a massage or anything, and my friend and I rented motorcycles in Vietnam, and I don't know how many or where, but I think there were three or four times as many motorcycles as cars, and so the traffic itself was like a sign in the city, and we all had this concept of stuffing things together, so I figured it out and avoided it for a couple of days, and I guess I just got used to it, like a delivery person, and it was just a good app here and there, so it was easy to find and eat delicious food.\nreceiver: Uh, you said earlier that Mr. Name2 is very popular in Japan.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I actually felt that loneliness in Vietnam, and yes, I honestly missed a little bit of Vietnamese food, and I didn't drive a motorcycle, I just took an Uber cab, and I couldn't really feel the traffic jams, and when I was driving to India, the car was so messy, I couldn' t even get across the sidewalk.\ncaller: But it wasn't a good trip to Vietnam.\nreceiver: It sure felt good to be rich and be a prince.\ncaller: Wouldn't you like to come back sometime?\nreceiver: I have the will, and I want to go.\ncaller: Yeah, well, if anyone asks me again, if you want to go with me, I'd really like to go again.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I don't really care about what kind of negotiations and deals North Korea is making with the U.S. over nuclear weapons, which has been going on for years, and it's the issue of the day right now, because it's nuclear.\nreceiver: I know there's a lot of global opinion that when our country is unified, it's going to be uncomfortable for a while, but it will be positive, as everyone thinks, and there's this fear that our country is going to make a lot of progress, and then there's some backstory that there's an idea that it will prevent the unification, and there are some backstories that there is an idea that there are U.S. troops in our country, and it's almost an axis, and on the American side, they don't have nuclear weapons, but they think that maybe they should have more power, and because they have them, they think that their weapons are a little bit less powerful.\ncaller: I don't think that North Korea is the only problem, nor is it limited to North Korea and the U.S. military, nor do I think that there is any country in the world that doesn't have anything to do with North Korea, and I think that the actions of the United States are not for anyone, but for the interest of their own country, and negotiations, and maybe war, and everything is for the United States.\nreceiver: We think that the ideal world is a country that doesn't have a nuclear weapon, but we think about the greed of our own countries, and that's why we're always looking for something to gain, and trying to get a little bit more, and so I think we're still weighing something with the nuclear weapon, and I think there's some people who have thought at one time or another about what it would be like if Korea had a nuclear weapon. So I think you'd like to see some progress being made in secrecy, and if you do have one, it should be a story between North Korea and South Korea, and when it comes to North Korea, where other countries are making a little more noise, it's not because we're weak that we don't have one, so we're going to be stronger if we have a nuclear device, so I think a lot of people are wondering if we're not going to be able to make more stories, and we've been talking about how we need to make our country's nuclear arsenal from such a thin, dry place, but I think it's time for Trump to take action, and I know\ncaller: I don't know if the U.S. has a nuclear weapon, but North Korea certainly has one, so whether or not they have it, if they don't have it, it's because someone else has it, and if they do, they're not allowed to have it, and they just want to have it.\nreceiver: I've been hearing about it for so long, and I'm going to hear a lot of this in the next two years, in the next five years, maybe in the next 10 years, and it's still going to be about the nuclear, and when we're in a situation where we're holding the nuclear, I think it's more important how the unification happens than when it happens or not.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Your client's name is Kim Sura, a financial advisor at East Asia Securities East Asia. Can I help you?\ncaller: Yes, hello. It's just that I'm so uncomfortable carrying a security card around trying to do internet banking, that when I look at the internet, there's a window that says there's an online way to issue an OTP card, and I'm trying to issue a mobile OTP card.\ncaller: I thought it was easy to do with an app, but my son and daughter are at work, and there's no one to tell them, and my husband doesn't know how to use his cell phone, and now I want to try it on my own, but I'm still a little bit inexperienced, so I called a counselor.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.\ncaller: I don't know how to use a cell phone. Can you tell me from the beginning?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: I was told to go to the App Store and search for a financial app and download it, which I'd put away in the old days because my daughter had something to write about, but now I don't know what to do.\ncaller: There it is. There it is, there's a three-letter circle in the lower left corner. I touched it, but there's so much to choose from here.\ncaller: Oh, there's an authentication box. You press it, you see an OTP box. If you press this, you'll see a mobile OTP at the bottom. That's right, but I have to go to the store and do that.\ncaller: I want to do it at home because it's a trade show. No, no, I'm sorry. I thought that was the only way to go to the store, but there's a home release button.\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: I'm sorry, I thought that was the only way to get to the store, but there's a home button, you just press it, and then what happens?\nreceiver: Next, you'll need to provide your ID.\ncaller: I'm going to give you two more spaces here, and I'll give you a valid ID card and a mobile phone ID card, and you can do that with your phone, but the valid ID card expired, so you can't use it, and the phone is registered in my name.\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Yes, and then I'll get an ID on my phone, which I can do very well, because I did it last time, and I wrote my phone number, I wrote my social security number, and I got a text, I wrote 8888, is that it?\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: Uh, here's my ID card. I didn't know I had to bring it. Can you hold on a second? I have the wallet with the ID card in the glove compartment.\nreceiver: Yes, I will.\ncaller: Thank you, I'll be back as soon as I can.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Yes, I did. It's quick to authenticate, and it's so easy to do these days, it's amazing that people like me can do it quickly, because it's quick and easy to authenticate yourself.\ncaller: I've authenticated all the accounts here, and I've set up all the passwords that I'm going to keep using, so it's easier to save the accounts that need to be moved in the old days, thankfully.\ncaller: I have to set a transfer limit here, and I'm wondering if I can set one for when I send money, because I think I'm going to spend a lot of money.\ncaller: Oh, there's a button to set it to the maximum amount, and fortunately, the maximum amount you can send at one time is no less than the amount I have to spend.\ncaller: But, you know, when this OTP card starts being issued to my mobile, I can't use the security card that I have now, it just pops up in the navigation window.\ncaller: OK, but I think it's going to be more convenient to use in everyday life, so I'm going to go with this one.\nreceiver: Is there anything else you'd like to ask me?\ncaller: I'm sorry, but there's one more thing I need to ask you. I need to build this and use it in real life, but I don't know how to use it yet. Can you tell me how to transfer accounts?\ncaller: Thank you very much. I'll follow your lead.\ncaller: So I'm just going to do this for practice, and I'm going to deposit 100 yuan, and then I'll select the deposit account, and then press the transfer button, and it's going to ask you to enter the OTP, and you're just going to have to enter that.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: It's okay. Thank you. The counselor was kind enough to let me off the hook. It's easy to understand, and I think it's easy for you to tell your friends, because all you have to do is install the app, authenticate yourself, and set it up.\nreceiver: Your client, do you have any further questions?\ncaller: I don't think so. Thank you very much for your kind explanation.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you. I'm Kim Sura, financial advisor at Easton Securities Easton.

You have a product subscribed in March 2015.\ncaller: Yeah, that's when I joined, 'cause I thought maybe I should quit.\ncaller: If you're fired, you're affected by the principal. When I applied for a new one, the bank staff kindly told me at the bank window, I don't know where the promissory note and these things went. If you look for them, they'll be there.\nreceiver: This is a ten-year/decade payment.\ncaller: Can you tell me what the interest is now? It's a few hundred thousand won, but it's a lot of money every day and every month, so it's burdensome. Because of the hospital expenses, I need money urgently, it's an intimate thing, and I tell my husband something. I want to ask him to spend on something, but I'm struggling, why are you burdening me with this?\nreceiver: So far, the original amount is 24,000 yuan. This is 64325 yuan.\ncaller: Um, I put it close, and that's all it takes?\ncaller: I heard the interest rate is high, but I don't think it is either. Is it better to terminate than to have this? I thought it would be a plus? Surprising.\ncaller: I was going to use it in a bunch of different places, but that's not good enough, because I was thinking about using it in this way, and it's even more wasteful.\ncaller: It's a popular product because the interest rate is higher than that of the checkout counter.\nreceiver: It's a popular commodity because it has a higher interest rate than entry-exit stamps.\ncaller: I mean, if you put a couple of hundred dollars into an entry-exit receipt, do you really get a hundred dollars in interest, because the interest rate is so low that your assets don't grow, and the interest on your loans doesn't change at all, it's very confusing.\ncaller: And the irony is that it's much better for a tribe to just pay off all their loans.\nreceiver: Can I finish?\ncaller: No, if you cancel it -- I mean, can you cancel it here? Can you deposit it right away? Can you do it at the customer center? Or do you have to go to the bank?\nreceiver: It can be done right away.\ncaller: So, can you recommend a good deposit product these days, because I think it's better to keep one as a replacement product, because I'll just let it go and use it, because when the money comes in, all of a sudden there's so much to spend that it's gone in an instant, so I think it would be better to sign up for another product and then get vulnerable.\nreceiver: Deposits and so on have lower interest rates than bonds.\ncaller: Yeah, there's a lot of negative interest these days, and if you put your money in a bank, you have to pay for it. (That's what they say) / That's what I think is best. So unless you have a big problem, or you don't need to spend money, or you're in a hurry, maybe it's better not to do it and just take it.\nreceiver: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?\ncaller: I'd rather just get rid of it, because the interest rate is so low anyway, and I'd prefer to just put it in an apartment loan and have a million bucks to spare. I'm trying to put in a few thousand bucks a month, but I forget, I forget the date, I care, I'm stressed. Just let it go.\nreceiver: I've got a call coming in from the customer service center, if you can hear the number.\ncaller: If you call during the consultation, does this continue? Can you keep getting calls while you're in the consultation? Or do you text? Do you have to start from scratch if you want to go back to a consultation?\nreceiver: It's a process in the course of counseling.\ncaller: Oh, yeah, you've checked the system. Yes, hello. (1345th) / (three hundred and forty-five times a day).\nreceiver: Yes, sir, may I see some identification?\ncaller: Identity card? Citizenship card? You lose your citizenship card, you have to go get it reissued, maybe a driver's license? It's probably in your wallet.\ncaller: Where's your wallet? Where'd you put it? Last time I went to the supermarket and took a bag, there must be a wallet in it. What did the bag take? I had a lunch appointment that day, so I went out wearing a woolen jacket and a coat. The bag I took with me was black. Oh, I found it.\nreceiver: Do you have a driver's license? Please state in order of date of issue.\ncaller: (2017 year) /{two thousand seventeen} June/{July} (fifth) /{fifth day) is the date on the bottom of the issuing machine (written) /{written}, right?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right. Your client has been terminated. How can I help you with the deposit?\ncaller: Wait a minute, I don't have time to go to the bank, so I'm going to have to split this up and deposit it, because one of them has to be deposited at the checkout counter.\ncaller: Because you're moving, plus moving, and you're paying a fee?\ncaller: Do I have to pay a fee? Or is it free? The deposit statement is the bank's account number (423-1234-85)\nreceiver: The fee is a one-time/one-day exemption.\ncaller: I've asked my husband to send me some money, but I can't, because it's too much work, and I can do it myself, and you'll have a lot of other consultations.\nreceiver: Let's take a look.\ncaller: I've got three/three accounts in my bank account, so I'm just going to put it in my checking account, and then I'm going to transfer the rest of it, and I have to pay off my credit card this month, so I just put it in the checking account.\nreceiver: The customer's account is verified.\ncaller: If you can do more than what I'm doing, would you just do it? If you say you're going to do it once or later, you're not going to be able to do it.\nreceiver: Can I transfer the original money to 245 and 248?\ncaller: Yes, deposit it. Put the rest of the interest in another account, but don't touch the principal. It's not a living expense, it's something I've managed well, so I should use my savings, which is better.\ncaller: I'll have to buy some food for her tonight. Please deposit it into another account. 1234.\nreceiver: Yes, I made a deposit.\ncaller: So it's completely eliminated, can we get rid of the ledger, can we remove the magnetic black on the back like this one in the bank and get rid of it?\nreceiver: Yes, sir, you can take it to the bank.\ncaller: I'm just going to have to tear them up and throw them away, one by one, because voicemail and voice phishing are so scary these days, and if they're abused, it's a big deal.\nreceiver: It was a consultant, Yonghee.

Can I help you?\ncaller: Hi, I'm interested in taking out a home equity loan, but since the market is so volatile these days, I was wondering if there are any products that allow you to take out a fixed rate loan until it matures.\nreceiver: Please provide your name and contact information for accurate consultation.\ncaller: Now, I'm a homeless person looking to buy a home, or I'm just a homeowner, and I'm looking at mortgage loans to sell my home, and I consulted other financial institutions first, and they only deal with floating rates, so I contacted the Sharing Bank to see if they had a fixed rate product.\ncaller: It's not just a fixed-rate mortgage, it's an interest-only mortgage, and you have to pay the principal and the interest at the same time on the day of the loan.\ncaller: And the term of the loan is up to 30 years, so even if it's a long term loan, I think it's okay to have an equity return.\ncaller: The housing should be apartments, condos, and single-family homes, and not city-style homes or offices, and the price of the housing has to be $900,000,000, because the housing I'm trying to sell right now is an apartment, and I'm looking to sell a house that's less than $90,000,000, so the loan is available.\ncaller: If the house is in a foreclosure zone or if the interest rate is not in line with my income, then there's a loan limit, but it doesn't mean that you can't get a loan at all, it means that the amount you can borrow may be reduced because your income is less than 70 million yuan.\ncaller: The more volatile the market is, the more likely it is that you're going to continue to have a fixed-rate loan with a lower interest rate at the beginning of the year, and you'll be able to use it in times of higher interest rates, like these days, where you have to worry about fluctuations in interest rates, and you don't have to be sensitive to fluctuations when you have a fixed rate.\ncaller: But the disadvantage of a declining interest rate is that you don't get the benefit of the decline in interest rates, and I don't think it's going to get any lower than it is right now, because if it gets any lower, the benchmark rate is going to be negative, and that's hard to do.\ncaller: It's not a common loan product, it's a product that is guaranteed and loaned by the Korean financial industry, so it's difficult to join if the limit is exhausted in the Korean financial sector, but it is a product guaranteed by the Korea financial industry, and I wonder why other financial institutions are not selling it. When I called several financial institutions, they did not indicate this product.\ncaller: The other financial institutions may not be selling because of their policies, but on the financial institution side, it's not profitable, so there's not a lot of banks that are selling these products.\ncaller: I'm wondering if you have to pay back the loan if your salary increases after taking out the loan, or if you can pay back as much as your income increases and keep the rest.\ncaller: If you own a house with a share-rate mortgage and you sell it and you own another house, you have to pay back the money you borrowed, because if you have a house that's not a homeless giant or a house that has a share rate mortgage, you're eligible for a share mortgage on the condition that you sell it within two years.\ncaller: If I had to sell a house that had a fixed-rate home equity loan, I wonder if the buyer would be able to take out this loan, and I wonder if I could take out the loan again when I buy another house.\ncaller: You're saying that if the buyer meets the eligibility requirements for this loan, they can get a loan forgiveness, but if they don't meet the loan eligibility criteria, they have to pay back the loan.\ncaller: And then when you buy another house, you're told that if you have a product like the Sharing Fixed Rate Home Equity Loan that the Korean financial industry sells and you qualify for it, you can sign up, but if you don't, you have to sign up for another loan product.\ncaller: The term of the loan can be up to 500 million yuan, the maximum term is 30 years, but it can be 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years, you can set the loan term depending on the repayment interest rate, regardless of the loan term, the repayments method should be equal to the principal and interest repayments.\ncaller: It's possible to get a home equity line of credit in the form of a share-based fixed-rate mortgage, but the only difference is that the interest rate is 1.5% higher than a typical short-term loan, and there are no conditions or anything else.\ncaller: You said that the principal repayment period is one month, and the loan's first execution date is the principal payday, so you can register the automatic repayment date on the same day you get the loan.\ncaller: To apply for a Sharing Fixed Rate Home Insurance Loan, you just need to bring your registration card, ID card, income-related documents, and go to the sales office.\ncaller: I contacted a bunch of financial institutions, and they had a lot of problems because they only deal with variable interest rates, and fortunately, there's a shared fixed-rate mortgage product, and the counselor's guidance was very helpful.\ncaller: Thank you so much for your kind response, I had a lot of questions and it was very helpful.\nreceiver: Do you have any other questions?\nreceiver: Thank you.

In any case, this is the reason why we can't change the vote of these people in any way, so we have to play the voices of the people in such a weak way so that the people can see it from the point of view of the people's votes, so now the media must be more attentive to it, so the people can use it, so of course there is no easy way to use it and there are\ncaller: Well, I'm always thinking about it, and I'm not confident, and I hesitate a lot in elections, because one of the reasons is that voters don't know exactly what the voter's record is, what the fish are, what they've caught, and what their character is going to be, so my vote for 100 pounds of fish is always ruined every time I'm eligible to vote, and I think other voters probably think the same thing about the people I'm voting for, because the fish are delivered to their homes, but the mail is delivered, but that's the only information I can read about him, and it's too difficult for me to read about the fish, so the voters in the Scottish government are asking about the candidate's character, or what he's caught, because his promises are going to be big, but participating in the elections, even before that, there's a little bit of information about how much his promises have been fulfilled, and how many of his promises were fulfilled.\nreceiver: I've seen the movie, I've heard the story, I remember the actors, and I remember the story, and I thought, well, history is always on the winner's side, and we've never had an invasion in our country's history of five and a half million years, and I think that's a very shameful history, and it's not because some white people were good enough to not invade, but because they couldn't.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

What's your relationship with him?\nreceiver: I don't know Kim Ji Hyun very well.\ncaller: You don't know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: That's because on Tuesday, our investigative team arrested eight people who were involved in a financial crime, led by a man named Kim Jong-hyun, in the Mapo district of Seoul.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: When we searched this man, we found a large quantity of counterfeit international credit cards, citizenship certificates, and bullion containers, but among them were a bank account in his own name, a bank account from the Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, so we contacted him.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Have you ever opened an account under that alias and given it to someone else or assaulted someone?\nreceiver: I never have.\ncaller: So have you ever dealt with a bank or a cooperative bank?\nreceiver: I only deal in the Straits.\ncaller: You've checked with us about the opening of the account on November 14th, 2014 at the Mapo Shopping Mall in Seoul, and on November 21st, 2014 you opened a bank account at the Hansa-dong branch in Songfa-gu, right?\nreceiver: I've never opened a bank.\ncaller: Have you ever inaugurated one?\nreceiver: What is the Strait of Hormuz?\ncaller: On the 14th of November, 2014, we crossed the Isthmus from the Mapo distillery in Seoul.\nreceiver: I've never been there.\ncaller: From now on...\nreceiver: I keep the river alive, and I don't deal with anything but the river.\ncaller: Are you telling me that no one has ever been to Seoul in November?\nreceiver: I've never been to Seoul.\ncaller: This case right now, it's not just about me, it is about a lot of people.\nreceiver: What about me?\ncaller: No, this case, it's not just one of you, there are almost 300 people involved in this case.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Now, many of you have been doing some research, and you've seen that a lot of people have been selling their containers for money because they're struggling to make ends meet.\nreceiver: I know that, roughly.\ncaller: And some of you, and there's a lot of you, have suffered this kind of damage as a result of an Internet hacking incident, because of a data breach, so in any case, if you're the victim, I want you to identify yourself as the victim, and if you are the perpetrator, you will be legally punished according to the laws of the Republic of Korea.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And first of all, for me, there's a process to an investigation, and I'm going to start with a one-on-one call recording.\nreceiver: That I should be investigated as a victim?\ncaller: We've arrested a man named Kim Dae Hyun, who is now the head of Han Bank, which is now in his own name, and the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, where he's been laundering 12 million yuan of illegal funds.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And if you're not involved in this at all, we're going to take steps to stop you from getting hurt again, and we'll put you on a privacy alert right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then we're going to record all of these conversations and keep them as legal evidence.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: So I'm going to record it tomorrow, and I'm just going to ask you a few questions, and you're going to tell me what you know.\nreceiver: Hi.

classify: <conversation>\ncaller: There's been a report that out of the 60 members of the arts and physical education staff who are required to fill their court-service hours on sick leave, 31 of them have either submitted false transcripts or overstayed their time.\nreceiver: And I think that in the Department of the Army, out of those 85 people, about half of them, a lot of people are now receiving military benefits, and they're filing for court-martial, and they didn't qualify for it, and I think they're getting benefits even though they're unqualified, and there's about 25 people that the Department hasn't even interviewed in person yet, and they got benefits, even though they were judged to be ineligible.\ncaller: According to the article, we can't really judge whether it's a mistake by the War Department or an administrative error by the Department of the Treasury, but I think it's incredibly, incredibly unequal if you give an exemption to an unqualified person, and I think that's a tremendous and unreasonably unequal thing, because men in this country are obligated to serve in the military after the age of twenty, and those of us who are doing artistic activities or sporting activities, who are doing good fishing, we know that instead of spending that time in the military, they're being made to do it, and it's called service time, and it seems to be abused, so I think that that's very inappropriate, and then how do you think about continuing to have this privilege of service?\nreceiver: I think that the privilege of enlistment, as you've just said, is to increase the amount of time and to make false statements, and to submit certificates, and to get legal advice, and to have those obstructions of justice, and those glaring things, and to strengthen the administrative errors in the archives, and to thoroughly check those things, and those investigative warrants, and warnings, and things like that, and also to tighten up the measures, so that now these people can perform their military duties normally, without submitting false statements or anything like that.\ncaller: I don't think it's right, not just for the Ministry of Education, but also for the Military Police, or any other government agency, to give special privileges to artists who are so talented that they deserve special privileges, but I don' t know if it's possible, even though they are unqualified, to give them an exemption from military service, because there are so many unreasonably different kinds of civilian patients and other artistic physical activities that faithfully fulfill their legal service, and it makes them feel very awkward or unequal, and I think this should never happen in the future.\nreceiver: When I think about the privilege of military service, I think it's right that the decision to exempt from military service people who, as you just said, are representatives of the state, who are very beneficial to society, and I think, as you've just said, maybe the military department will present this false fact and give a little stronger punishment to these people for obstructing the execution of official duties or for violating the military service law, despite the fact that they are incompetent and incompetent, and what do you think about him?\ncaller: Not just the gymnastics guy who was suspended for overtime, but all the other artistic gymnastics guys who were suspended for this kind of thing, even though they didn't do it or didn't want to do it, but pretty much all the guys who did this kind of stuff, we'd like to see more than just a fine, we would like to see a stronger punishment, and we'd have to keep asking questions about the suspension.\nreceiver: I'm all for granting military exemptions to athletes like the World Cup or the national team, who are now making their mark in that field, but I'd like to see stronger legal action against those who misuse the system of military exemptions by spreading falsehoods, blowing up time, and lying about it to support military service even though they didn't do it themselves, rather than a fine like you just said.\ncaller: I don't know if it's an administrative error of the Ministry of Education, but it's very wrong to give exemption to non-commissioned officers, even though they're not commissioned, and it's something that should never happen in the future, and in addition to this, the Ministry of Defence is going to increase the scrutiny of those who are eligible to receive these benefits by conducting an investigation first to see who is eligible for these benefits, and after a thorough examination, I think we need to look carefully at whether these people are doing the right thing.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system

I agree with that, but I'm kind of confused about how to set a standard for it, and how much this guy has done while he's at number one.\ncaller: I think that this privilege is given to people who have some recognition in the country for what they do, and there are artistic giants and people who are good at sports, and they give military privileges to people who are, quite simply, good at their studies, and they're good at their language development, and they may be the best in the field of music research, and I don't know why it's limited to the arts and the physical sciences, but when I saw this article, I can't tell you that the military privilege for artists and gymnasts, for all the men in this country, is right or wrong in the minds of men, but personally, I think it's wrong, because it's better to create a comprehensive standard in all the fields and give military privilege to everyone who has an excellent ability in any field and is recognized in the country, and I think it would be more reasonable to think that the Department of Military Intelligence and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are conducting an investigation into this issue of military privilege, and we don't have any credibility in the media.\nreceiver: So I think it's better to do this kind of work from the outside, rather than from the department that's in charge of it, because it's already there, and if the same people check it again, and they check it, and they find it, they're going to hide it and they'll find it the same way, so we're wondering, what if there's another department, or maybe a higher department, that does this kind of investigation or verification, and then we're asking questions, and then there's this kind of high-level, peculiar issue, and these people have done something, and they've made this up, and they have done this kind of bad thing, and then they have to think about punishing people.\ncaller: Of course, I think there should be a punishment, but I don't think it's specific about the criteria of the punishment and the content of the punishment, do you think that in the past, celebrities should be punished like that, and so there was a case of going to the army again, which was a lot of issues at the time, but in the end, after a while, instead of saying that he had been in the army more deservedly, well, I'm glad that's how it was treated.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It's a story that was on TV Mescom from 2013 to 2012, and now Kim Yong-soo is accused of involvement.\nreceiver: How did you do that?\ncaller: Kim Yong-soo's account now has over $70 million in transactions, and there's still $26 million in his account.\nWe're all investigating it now in the Cyber Investigation Division, so here it is.\nreceiver: What about our current account number?\ncaller: The account number is not verifiable on our end.\nIt's quicker for you to call the D.A.'s office directly than it would be for you to ask us.\nreceiver: Where am I supposed to ask?\ncaller: That's what connected us. Why do you ask?\nreceiver: What do you mean?\ncaller: You put me through to the DA's office.\nreceiver: No, I mean, I'm gonna check it out right now, see if I can get to the D.A.'s office and make a call here.\ncaller: Please contact the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.\nreceiver: What's your last name?\ncaller: Yeah, we'll put you on the inside line, so you can call it there, all right?\nreceiver: Hey, wait a second.\ncaller: Please say yes.\nreceiver: No, it's a direct link from the police station to the DA's office.\ncaller: I can connect you directly to our internal line.\nreceiver: So what's the computer team? What's the class?\ncaller: We'll put you in touch with the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.\nreceiver: What's the name of the coroner?\ncaller: Didn't you ask him about that?\nreceiver: I'll be right with you.\ncaller: Are you now your father's husband, or are you becoming your father?\nreceiver: I'm the officer, and I'm checking it out, and it doesn't say anything.\ncaller: You're a police officer.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Are you still a police officer?\nreceiver: You're talking nonsense, this guy impersonating a cop again.\ncaller: That's a major crime.\nreceiver: What's the punishment?\ncaller: I'm curious, but let me ask you a personal question. What's your last name?\nreceiver: You don't need to know that, Mr. Kim Hyung. What's the name of the head of the video camera department?\ncaller: Dad, we're being recorded right now.\nreceiver: I'm recording too.\ncaller: Let's talk about that, shall we?\nreceiver: What's the detective's name?\ncaller: Come in handcuffed, and let's see if you can understand that by looking at my face, okay?\nreceiver: I'm going to cuff you. Come on.\ncaller: Hey, this guy's trying to help the suspects because I'm trying to help him.\nreceiver: Cut the crap, you son of a bitch.

I didn't watch it that well before, but I started watching it again last year when the cast changed. Before, the games and stuff between the cast members were so competitive, and so it must have been a little uncomfortable, but now the cast members are kind of casual, and it's just fun to watch it without any pressure. And the quiz on The Block is a show that involves ordinary people listening to the stories of ordinary actors who live a little bit, and there's a lot of sympathy and a lot of touching points when you see the show.\ncaller: Now, I don't watch the majority of my TV shows, but there are a lot of channels on YouTube, and instead of watching TV shows these days, I like to watch TV shows, and I also like to watch old shows that are uploaded shortly and then watched again, and compared to TV, YouTube doesn't have any time constraints, so you can watch it anytime, anywhere, and it's more convenient.\nreceiver: No, I'm not a big fan of rewatching, I usually watch a lot of the original, but I like that TV, but I don't think I like it enough to rewatch it. Let me ask you a question.\ncaller: I'm not really interested in celebrities, but I'm more interested in what's going on with Vijay and the African part of the show, and I think I've been watching a lot more Vijay shows lately, and I like Vijay people more than I like celebrities, and one of my favorite Vijay characters is King Ki-hoon. So let me ask you again, do you take care of your favorite actor when they're shooting a drama or performing?\nreceiver: I don't have a favorite celebrity lately, so I guess I haven't watched it lately, but until a few years ago, I had a favorite singer, and I used to watch music shows and radio shows with that singer and I went to concerts and I went on the radio a lot, and I was like, I've never seen those African TV shows or anything like that, but if you know them at first glance, you know that they're all non-subject-specific content, and you know that there's a lot of this kind of stuff, but do you know what your favorite non-subjective program is?\ncaller: My favorite things about Vijay are communication and dining, and these days Vijay makes me eat a lot of food, or substitute food, to satisfy other people, so that I can substitute food when I'm on a diet, or when I can't eat, and I think that's a good thing, because Vijay also creates interesting content, and when I interact with viewers, or have a relapse, I think I feel more fun, more fun, and more enjoyable because of that relapse.\nreceiver: First of all, I think I'm going to have a lot of anxiety, because if that show ends, I don't think I'll be looking at another show to take its place, so if there's a show that I'm comfortable with or that I've been touched by or something like that, I'll look at another show, but if not, I'm just going to go with the show, and I'll just stay with the show.\ncaller: I used to like Vittius, but I don't like him now. I'll ask you again, do you enjoy watching the news on TV?\nreceiver: Yes, I watch the news on TVB every day, and at eight o'clock it's convenient to watch the Embassy news, and at nine I watch the KVIS news, and in addition to that, I watch a YouTube broadcast every morning related to the show.\ncaller: I don't like to watch the news or talk shows on TV, and I'm too ignorant about politics and economics, so I figured my dad would have to pick up the news and show it to me, and since then I haven't picked up the news on TV, but I do occasionally watch it on my phone, so I'll ask you again, there's been a lot of suicides in the entertainment industry lately, what do you think about this?\nreceiver: Being a celebrity is a very glamorous job, but I think there's a lot of things that you have to deal with, and you can get some kind of popularity and a little bit of economic wealth and honor, and then you have some kind of limited privacy and anti-fans and, uh, a lot of schedules, and you have to take a lot of physical hardships and so on, because we have a lot of older people in the entertainment industry, and there are a lot of activities that are a little bit more difficult to deal with at that young age, and I think there are many unpleasant things like that, and it's important to take care of that psychological care at the affiliate level, so you have to consume those celebrities who like ordinary celebrities, and we ordinary people have to improve our awareness of these celebrities a little bit, and we have to think that we have to give them some kind of care so that they can live their lives as human beings.\ncaller: It's not that I like the band or don't like them, it's just that when I was in high school, my friends happened to be watching the band's music videos, and they were sitting next to me, listening to the songs, and watching the music videos with me, so naturally I became a fan of the band, but then the band had a little bit of a hiatus, so I guess I didn't become a fan naturally.\nreceiver: I think it makes it easier for people to express themselves and express what's on their minds, or what they're just saying out of the blue, and as I said before, that kind of nastiness has a negative impact on celebrities, and I think we should get rid of that nastiness culture.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It took about a week/day last time, so I have to wait another week/day?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was on the bus because I didn't take a picture of it today?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I make a new one and I get the card, does the card come to my home or does it come to my office?\nreceiver: We can do both.\ncaller: If you want to use a transit card, can you get a card and use it immediately?\ncaller: Have you ever used a transit card?\ncaller: If you have multiple cards in your wallet, is there a chance it won't be printed?\ncaller: Is the payment in advance or in arrears?\nreceiver: It's an afterthought.\ncaller: So we're going to be charged the same number of times that we used our transit card.\ncaller: And I saw on the website that there's a shopping service, and if you buy more than 5,000 yuan per month, you get a discount at the mall, right?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: This isn't a separate application, so I'm just going to write it?\ncaller: Shopping malls have been set up, 12th Street/Tenth Avenue, and only Jun Market is available, right?\ncaller: The monthly discount limit is $10,000, but you can't discount more than that.\ncaller: Are there any restrictions on what I can buy, whether it's clothes or books or whatever I'm buying in the mall?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: My card is also a reassurance payment service, right?\ncaller: I do a lot of shopping every month, so can you give me a discount?\nreceiver: Yes, it is impossible.\ncaller: It's a little weaker than other credit cards.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: The other four cards have a lot of perks, and a lot of extras, and I think you're going to have to do some digging.\nreceiver: Thank you for your valuable comments.\ncaller: Yeah, and in addition to my card service, I also have a cell phone repair service, so is that a personal expense?\ncaller: How much is it?\nreceiver: It's going to be $30,000/$30,000.\ncaller: Even though I didn't do anything wrong, do I have to pay for it myself?\nreceiver: Yes, it does.\ncaller: The reward limit is 100,000 won/100,000 won, right?\ncaller: Overall, card support is a little weak.\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: Is the support different for each card?\ncaller: What's the card with the most extras?\nreceiver: This is a plus/minus card.\ncaller: Is that a transit card service?\nreceiver: So that's a yes.\ncaller: All the shopping support services?\ncaller: Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you, and maybe I'll compare it to other cards, but I don't really like it.\nreceiver: I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I'm not averse to watching it, but I do not like it, and thriller is a genre that I've been loving lately.\nreceiver: I think my favorite movie genre is, like, comic, animated, action fantasy kind of stuff, and the actors in the movies, I think I mostly like, like, acting actors, and, you know, like, uh, or, uh, uh, the weight in the movies isn't a big part, but it's a lot of eyes on the cast, and I think I like actors like that, uh, well, name 1, do you remember the first movie you saw when you were a kid, what was the plot of that movie?\ncaller: The first movie you saw when you were a kid was probably Harry Potter, or I was alone at home, and I think that's what happened to me when I was a kid, and it was a made-for-television movie, and then my mother's friend got me tickets to see Harry Potter at the Caviece theater, and I don't think it was the first time I'd seen it in a movie theater, but I thought, well, you know, it's a story about the wizarding world, and lately it's been kind of hard to explain, but it's like Harry Potter in my world, so it's kind of difficult to explain.\nreceiver: I remember when I was a kid, the first time I ever saw a movie, it was called \"Permanent\" or \"Permanence\" or something like that, it was directed by the director of that time, and before that, I always watched the usual cartoons on television, and I remember the first movie as \"Permanently\", and I loved it, and I watched a lot of shows, and I cried, and I laughed, and I saw a lot of things, and I still remember, \"What is the movie of Mr. Name1's life and why?\"\ncaller: Well, I'd say it's a foreign adaptation of Hello, and it's an adaptation of what was going on at the time when black people were playing a role in the black people's movement, and I think it's almost based on a true story, and I didn't mention it before, but I like stories based on true stories because I think there was a little bit more interest in it, and there was a bit of a lack of that kind of narrative about how I like movies based on real life and how it's related to the black movement, but there's a little bit of that lack of white people helping out a little bit, and that's something that I've been thinking about a lot, and I thought maybe I could do that.\nreceiver: I like, uh, of course, domestic movies, but I'm a bit of a fan of Tom Hanks in foreign films, and there's a real-life Tom Hanks movie, where a plane crashes and Tom Hanks comes out of the plane and rescues the passengers, and my favorite movie is a movie called Forrest Gump, and I watched it and I thought a lot about how to live my life, and when I was a little bit depressed, I watched that movie, and it changed my mood, and the depression got a little bit better, and because Tom Hanks was so good at acting, I think I watched a lot of that movie and I felt a little bit relieved, and that's the movie of my life.\ncaller: Yes, as I said before, I like movies based on real life, and I would like to see a lot of movies like that, because I'd like to know things that I didn't know, and especially in the case of history, there are a few historical characters, and they're always the ones that pop up, but I think there are enough characters that I don't know who brought me, and I think it's good that they lived such a life, and so on.\nreceiver: The genre I don't like is horror movies, because they're a little bit too scary for that kind of effect or that kind of scene, and if you look at it, it's kind of scary when you're alone, so I honestly don't really like watching horror movies. It's the kind of genre that makes you think it's a waste of money to watch them, and I like watching everything but horror movies.\ncaller: I don't like horror movies as much as name2 does, but I'm not saying that I don' t watch them anymore, but I don' T like them that much, and I don'T like them that are a little too romantic, and I like them that have a little bit of comedy mixed in with it, but I just don't feel that they' re a lot of fun when they're just a little bit pure melody, or the part where that melody comes out, and I was wondering if you've seen any of the parasites that have been on the news lately, and if you have, I'd like to know what your thoughts are.\nreceiver: I've seen your film Parasite. I'm sorry I didn't see it when I went to the cinema, but I saw a movie called Parasite because the groom downloaded it. At first, I thought it was a little bit crazy, and at the end it was really crazy. I thought about it, and at first I thought it would be such a big hit, but when I saw the movie, I thought that it was so simple, and then I saw it, and I had a lot of happiness left behind, and I saw it again, and I thought, oh, it's a very good movie, oh, this director has a little bit of criticism of reality in his films, but I think that these things are so realistic now, and they've made such a good movie, and I think that people are enthusiastic about it, so I felt like a little bit, so when I saw it later, oh, I think it's going to be a really good movie, but I thought I'd see something like that, Mr. Name One, I wonder if I've ever seen a movie like that.\ncaller: Yeah, I saw Parasite in the theater, too, so I was kind of looking forward to seeing it because it won awards at the time, but I only saw Parasite once, and the reason I didn't see it was because I had a lot of stuff left over, and I was like, you know, I'm living under that ring, and I'm kind of weird about it, and there's all these things that make me think about why I saw this movie, and then I've been thinking a lot, and after watching Parasite, I like to look for interpretations behind the scenes, wondering if there's some kind of trick in the film, or if the directors have some kind of monster set up, because I'm so anxious to avoid it, and after seeing Parasite I've looked for interpretations of the film in a lot of different ways, and I don't know if I've seen a lot of those things, and I thought, well, I've probably seen Parasite one or two times, and I think it's probably because I've never seen one before, so I'm a little bit nervous.\nreceiver: I think I've had that same feeling when I've watched music, and I've seen some movies, and they do that on TV, and I don't think I'll ever want to watch them again, and I thought, well, it's not the kind of movie I want to watch twice, and I recently downloaded a movie called Child Client, and it's about child abuse, and I was very upset when I saw it, and I said, well, there's a movie about child abuse that's based on a real-life story about a giant golden goose, and when I see that kind of thing, it makes me so sad, and it makes me angry, and I am so upset about my position as a parent, and it gives me a little bit of a sense of alarm, and I think we need to know if that's the kind of film we want to see, and if you've ever seen a film about child abuse tell me what you think about it.\ncaller: I remember watching a movie called Mischback, and I remember thinking that I was a little sad when I saw that movie, and I thought, well, it's a good thing there's a savior, but there's no such savior in reality, so I thought that part might be a bit of fiction, and then I thought, you know, he's an actor, and he's a bit of an actor, but I think his parents who abuse children are also very good actors, and his hysterical appearance, and the way he looks like he's neglectful, and I think those parts are a little bit memorable, and I said, well, I remember thinking about a movie called Donnie, and it's kind of a little bit of child abuse, and that's the kind of thing that kids have to take advantage of, and it has to be a little bit too intrusive, and the teacher who plays the role of a teacher is really upset, so I think a lot of guys have seen that movie.\nreceiver: Well, I was very angry when I saw Dogani, and I think I was very sad when I thought about those kids, and I don't want to see those movies, but because they're real events, I think it made us adults reflect a lot and think that we should really love and protect our children a lot.\ncaller: I'm like, oh my God, when I saw that movie yesterday where a friend gave me a movie ticket, I was like, \"Oh my God, I think I've seen a movie recently where the parasite is in it, and then I thought, oh my god, this is the movie I saw recently where Kim Ji-young is in it in '82, and there's a lot of synthetic sympathy there, and it's a little bit sad reality, so it's kind of a sad movie\".\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

So in the second-party damage of this process, which is the fact that the victims are more aware of the facts through Internet banking or mobile banking, and I've been told that the secondary damage is cases where you get your savings from hacking, and when you do the mobile banking or Internet banking procedure, it's a situation alert, because you don't even know when you're doing the procedure, but your account has been hacked, so you rely on this part to make sure that you're able to deal with it quickly.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And so I interviewed two people, and in the case of third-party damage, like the loan shark, in fact, most of them didn't recognize the fact of the damage, even through mobile banking or internet banking, because that's the part that's set up as collateral. So it's not the account itself that's vulnerable, it's the existence of the account itself, and it's even predictable, so they didn't recognise these parts. How the third-party damages were received, what kind of victim's overdraft was, and after the overdraft, they actually ask you to apply for the cancellation of a financial obligation, a black employee, for example, who said, \"You have to receive 10 million yuan, but you can get 60,000 yuan\". And then they talked about why you can get 2 million yuan, and you can't get 800 million yuan, because you've got collateral set up. And then they started thinking about the fact that you have to realize that you're a victim.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, since you're in a situation where you're talking to someone who's also a second-degree or third-degree victim, you're going to have to go through the process of proving that you're a victim, and if you're proven to be a victim, your security clearance will be upgraded, so let me give you a quick rundown of what you'll be investigated for in order to prove you are a victim.\nreceiver: So, yeah.\ncaller: Well, first of all, there's this thing called a property insurance application that you're going to get from the IRS.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, this part is that if you're a third party in your investigation, or you've suffered secondary or thirdary financial loss as a result of Kim Jong-un's actions, you can file a property insurance claim for compensation, and if you've had any financial dealings with Kim Jong-Un during this process, you'll be compensated, but you may also be punished.\nreceiver: I went to the penitentiary myself.\ncaller: Yeah, yeah, I got it.\nreceiver: What's going on today?\ncaller: Well, I'll give you an explanation, and once you've heard it, if you have any questions, please ask.\nreceiver: In the\ncaller: Now, we're going to move on to this part of the financial disclosure, where you're basically stating that this statement and the SEC's account tracking should be identical, that you can prove that you're a victim.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, I'm going to have this filed with the SEC, and you're right about your use of the shrimp depository and the new two-party bill.\nreceiver: Yes, and yes, you have my MOU, but I don't know if you're using it or not.\ncaller: You don't know exactly, and I'll let us check it out.\nreceiver: Yeah, I don't know if that counts as a point or something.\ncaller: You stated that you have about 30 million yuan in your savings account. Is this the part that you asked me directly? You've been holding on to that money for so long? What is it? Yes, I understand. This is the part that I'm going to pass on to the Financial Supervisory Authority, and as soon as you're a victim of this case, this is the part where we're investigating when and how your personal information was leaked and how it was opened to the person in charge in cases like this one. That's why I'm saying that there could be a problem if the contents of this case are disclosed to a third party before Friday's victim confirmation is completed.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So this is the part where you're going to have to say something about it, whether it's someone you know, or maybe you've said something to your family, but from our point of view, we don't know if you've actually spoken to someone you know or to someone who's involved in the case. So that's why I'm telling you now that you have to tell us a little bit about the incident before it's proven that you're a suspect. You know, you're not under investigation at the moment. I've already told you. First of all, I've told you that I've checked two call records before contacting you. If you've been found here with records of calls from the Kimmun disaster, then the non-contact person has been identified as a so-called contact person.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But I'm telling you that because you've been contacted, you're not the subject of a warrant at this time, so you can choose which way you want to be investigated, and I'm going to give you a little bit of an explanation of the two types of investigations that you can choose, because there's going to be an investigation anyway, so you have two choices in total. The first is execution of a search warrant. If you execute this part of the search warrant, there's nothing for you to do tomorrow. The election investigation will end here, your home will become a police station, and then you'll be able to come in and get investigated at a later date, depending on the time of day.\nreceiver: I'm going to go out there and get myself investigated.\ncaller: When you come in personally, there may be parts of the investigation that end in a day, or the investigation may take longer, but we have the authority to detain you for up to 72 hours to investigate, so at best you can leave after two or three days, and if you choose to execute it with a search warrant, the election investigation will end here, and all your financial rights will be frozen when the call is completed.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Why are the funds being frozen, the part where you could have fled abroad after the recording, or you could have stashed the funds, and basically you have to go to the financial controller on Friday to verify whether the alleged amount of money is legal or whether it contains illegal funds, but you can't do this part when you go through the execution of the warrant.\nreceiver: That's the first thing I did.\ncaller: And I'm helping myself, and you're helping me, and I'm the prosecutor, and if there's a loss, I'm going to be able to recover that loss, and you are going to cooperate with me, and then you're going to investigate the people involved, and see what happens if there is a loss, and that's why, as I said before, instead of being forced to investigate, you're actively cooperating with the investigation and you'll get three people after you're released by the financial controller tomorrow.\nreceiver: If you're going to investigate this collaboration, do you want me to go to the penitentiary and call it off?\ncaller: First of all, check whether you have a secondary or tertiary loss. If you are not part of the opening of the account, first of all, you will verify whether you have been affected by the illegal opening of an account due to embezzlement, and secondly, whether there is a secondary loss or third loss in another personal account. That is why you will visit the branch of the financial institution that you have opened.\nreceiver: I'll make it as a player.\ncaller: You say you're cooperating with the investigation, so I'm going to give you another choice, because when you cooperate, you're going to open up a case that's coming up, and at the same time that you're opening up the case, you'll be receiving a property insurance application from the Financial Conduct Authority, and when the property insurance application is received, you'd be deemed to have agreed to cooperate in the investigation, and you wouldn't be allowed to investigate, or you would be executing a warrant without cooperating.\nreceiver: I might not want to be contacted.\ncaller: No, when you're conducting that cooperative investigation, you're going to continue with the wiretapping part. You're not going to stop recording and go back and do this part, but you have to keep going. So why is it that obstruction of justice is established when you say you're investigating and then you interrupt, and in the same financial case, there's a time limit on your work hours. You've investigated because you're being compensated for damages, but you're proceeding to ensure that you're getting compensation, and if you don't investigate, you'll have time to investigate other victims in the meantime. In other cases of this case, these damages can be incurred without even knowing the facts of the damage, and you've been contacted by us, and you know that because of that part, soon, I'll be deemed to have obstructed an investigation, and a violation of law enforcement will be established.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're trying to prove the victim, and the victim is bad, but it's bad when you add the dismissal. That's why I'm telling you to think carefully and decide carefully. I don't know when the recording will end in cases like cooperative investigation, for example, say you have a second or third injury, then you have to investigate how much damage was done, where it happened, how it happened, and because that part is also your victim's money, if you go through recovery and apply for bank security upgrades, the event will take a long time.\nreceiver: Oh, but you said the first round of searches could be over in two or three days?\ncaller: Okay, the first one is that you're going to show up and be investigated, and the cooperative investigation ends on Friday, but you don't know when it's going to end on Friday, and we don't even know how long it will take, for example, when you visit a financial institution, and it's a new place, and it doesn't take a lot of time to get from a water source to a financial regulator.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

I love the visually stunning dessert cake, the dessert 39 cake, the cosmic cake, or the natural green tea cake, which is a representation of pepperoni, and there's a lot of cake around, and it's nice to see, and it tastes good, and sometimes when you're in a mood, you go to the Christmas table, and the cake is often on the table, and that's more than 15 pounds of sales a year, and you eat cake at Christmas.\ncaller: I didn't buy it myself, and I remember eating what someone else bought, but I don't think the cake should be on the Christmas table, because the bakery bread is no longer a stock in our lives, but it's a relationship that can't be traded like a stock, and it's not a character or a visual price, it's an aspect of our lives that needs to be developed more closely.\nreceiver: I'm talking about how baker's yeast should come closer to our lives, because cake, for example, counts the seconds to celebrate something, and then it burns, and then the visual elements in the food that we celebrate come together, and it's pretty, and we want to talk about it while we eat it, and we're getting closer, and that's why I think it's possible to draw a picture on a cake, write something like an anniversary, take a photo to commemorate it, and in that way bring together things that are closely related to our lives.\ncaller: I think it's a one-time thing, and I thought it was a four-for-one experience, and I think it was a very satisfying one, so I'm not going to do it again, because I've heard that the hotel bakery has a cake that sells for $50,000 or $100,000, what do you think?\nreceiver: If it's worth it, I'm going to buy it at that price, if it tastes a little bit better than other cakes, or if it's not just a little bit, it's more than 100,000 yuan, or if the design is really beautiful when someone sees it, or if there are parts of it, I think it's enough to give it that price, but the price of cakes has been getting a little bit higher lately, and desserts are being sold at convenience stores, and the price is going up a little bit from 3,000 to 4,000 to 7,000 yuan, and have you ever eaten a cake at a convenience store?\ncaller: I've never had a sliced cake, and I've had a roll cake, and the roll cake was delicious, and I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleased that it exceeded my expectations, but I'm not going to buy desserts from convenience stores again, because I've heard that a cake with a lot of characters sells well, and I like a cake with some characters.\nreceiver: Personally, I prefer a cake that's more artistic than a cake with characters that just try to express something, and I think the reason why a cake with a character sells so well is because it's familiar, like, for example, the penguin character was exposed to a lot of different people, and this time he's in the disability category, and people were exposed to him, and they're familiar with him, and I'm wondering if there's going to be a higher purchase rate for him because he's the same character that I've seen, and even modern art is starting to appear on top of the cake.\ncaller: And I think it's because of that intense feeling that contemporary art has, that we've even put it on the cake, because characters, frankly, for younger kids, they're an incentive to buy, for people of a lower age, and for other people of a higher age, I think we've gone to great lengths to find something that's as intense as that, and we've put it on Andy Warhol or artists like that, and there's a lot of cake-making academia and one-day-class baking academia, and you have to be willing to sign up for classes.\nreceiver: If you get the chance, I'm willing to take it. It's called DIY, which means I make it myself, and I can use whatever ingredients I want, like strawberries and chocolate, and it's fun to go out and make it with someone I want to go out with, but it's pretty memorable, and I'd like to go if I get the chance. People are looking for a lot of cute things to upload to Essence these days, and that includes cakes, and there's 50,000 posts on Instagram about cakes alone.\ncaller: I didn't buy it to upload it to Essence, but I've bought and uploaded a lot of pretty things and a lot of good things, and I've done some sales on Essence, so I know how to capture pretty things and write about them, and that's great, because there's a lot of them, but I have done some research, and I haven't bought them for the sake of it, but there's so much of this stuff on Essence and there's all these cakes and pretty things and bakery desserts and pretty things that go up and sell a lot, and you know, what do you think about that?\nreceiver: I think there's definitely a point to it, and I think the human mind is that when you see something beautiful on Essence, you want to buy it, and you want to know what it tastes like, and in order to promote that cake, you take a picture of it on Essence and you give it a free drink.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Can I help you?\ncaller: I'm confused about my card, and I want to use the mileage, but please let me know how many points I have, because I've used my card to collect my mileage, and it's confusing because I don't remember.\nreceiver: (Fifty thousand points) / (Ten thousand points) is confirmed.\ncaller: (50000 points) / (Oman points) Is that all you get? There's more to come. You got the names and the cards right, right?\ncaller: So my card number is 1234, then 5678, then 9012, then 3456, and it's a better plus credit card. There are a few other cards besides this one, so let's check this one first.\ncaller: o/ This card is (50000 points) / (80 points) right.\nreceiver: This card is [50000 points] over [0000 points].\ncaller: Recently, I spent a few days in a high-end restaurant to eat out, and I paid with this card, and I won a national tour event, and I'm going to travel, and I spent this much, and it's only 50,000 points, don't you understand?\ncaller: I've used it a lot, and I know that the more I use it in the terms and conditions, the more points I get, and I don't understand why this is happening.\nreceiver: I'm going to take you to 50,000 points/8,000 points.\ncaller: How much did you spend on this card? It's only 50,000 points. It's a minimum of 100,000 points. I have another bulletproof credit card.\nreceiver: Please confirm your card number.\ncaller: It's going to be 1234 again, and then it'll be 444 again, and it will be 555 again, and so on.\nreceiver: So this is going to be 40000 points over 40000 points.\ncaller: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I had points on one card, but I was wrong, because I've written so many cards together, and I've put together so many sharing cards, and I think that's a point. I'm confused because I'm getting older and my memory is getting worse.\ncaller: So what about the mileage? (1 year) / (one year) or (2 years) / (this year)? I think I've seen it in the pharmacy. I think it's a real memory loss.\ncaller: They see the terms and conditions, and they know it's okay to use a bookstore, a movie theater, a restaurant, a hotel, etc., but why can't you use an airplane?\ncaller: If you can link it to the airline mileage, that's great, but can you link this too? Ordinary transportation is the subway or the KTX or the SRT, so why not the airline?\ncaller: If you have a lot of mileage, it's going to save you money and make it easier for you to get around, so why don't you negotiate with the airline and make the airplane available?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I asked you before, you said you'd take care of this too, so why don't you always? If you want to help your customer's convenience, you have to check and reflect on these suggestions.\ncaller: How reflective is it? Is it still being negotiated? Is it going to be done by the middle of the year? The answer is yes. You have to reflect these things properly, use them lightly, and put cards around them.\nreceiver: I'll pass it on to the person in charge.\ncaller: If you don't use it by the deadline, you can use it for the next month, and if it's lost, it'll be remembered and used for another month.\ncaller: And if you can keep using the expiration number next year or next month, and the customer remembers that they didn't use it, and it's linked to a card payment, you want to keep using this card, right?\ncaller: And that's good, because the next time you're going to use it, you'll be able to keep it on schedule, and you won't have to make impulse purchases, so you don't need to spend unnecessarily, and you can help your family, and I think that's where the sharing card is really superior to other card providers.\ncaller: There's a Trump card that expires, and for whatever reason, you can't share it with someone else, and I really didn't want to use it.\nreceiver: Any unused points can be used later.\ncaller: And it's a sharing card, so if my family or friends give me their mileage, can I use it? I usually don't want to use it, or it's too much trouble for me to have a mileage allowance or a lease around, but it's not in the terms and conditions.\nreceiver: Both are possible.\ncaller: Is it really possible? W/sharing cards are flexible enough to handle this kind of thing, because you usually ask a lot of questions when you get a third-party mileage.\ncaller: For some reason, I've been asking a lot of questions about when and where and how to use a certain point, and there's a lot of verification procedures, and I get really annoyed when I have to ask this and that in the store when I'm paying, but I'm really glad that you're letting me use this right away.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: So you can use my card or someone else's card together?\ncaller: What if I have multiple shared cards in my name that I can use to overlay my mileage with a (1) / (a) card, and someone else has a shared card mileage that I have legitimate permission to use and their card mileage is linked to my card, and of course I can accrue additional mileage?\ncaller: But there are places where the use of the store is in each branch, and there are places that it is not. Why is that? The card company should be able to use it in the entire store.\ncaller: He really liked his coffee, and he wanted to order a bigger one and give it to her as a gift, and then he had to go to the Trump Hotel and pay for it, and there was a mileage limit, and he couldn't use it all, which was really uncomfortable.\nreceiver: It varies from store to store.\ncaller: So, as much as possible, if the stores are the same, we have to make everything available at all locations, wherever it is, and if it's not, there's a lot of problems with fairness and access. Sometimes when you pay with drive-thru, the kiosk doesn't work, and the sharing card takes a long time to load, and that's a shame.\ncaller: But it's nice to see a little bit of progress from the customer's point of view.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: But could you please send me your monthly mileage in a text message or an email or a chat like [sns]/[sns]+ [sns) /[sns], because I think it's discriminatory that people come and go, even if they have marketing agreements.\ncaller: I'm sorry about that, but I'm also sorry about the letter of introduction, so please do it now when you apply.\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: I'll send you a letter on the 15th day of every month.\ncaller: The text could be mistakenly treated as spam, so please send the email for the Sharing Card exclusive mail to (123@) / ((days two and three blasts) bullet year (.com) / ((point com) so that it can be checked at (15 days) / ((fifteen days)).\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: I'm sorry to bother you with so many questions, but I've always used a sharing card, and I'm sure your mom will think it's annoying because she doesn't have it, so please refer me to the person in charge and help me avoid any inconvenience when using it.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: If you have any further questions about mileage, we'll get back to you.\nreceiver: Thank you.

I think the reason why I like movies more than dramas is because they compress a lot of messages in a short amount of time, and that's why the romance in the movies is more dramatic and more moving to me than romance in dramas. And I also like romance films a little bit more than just romance, because I can interrupt the story a little bit and shed a lot of tears, and it's a bit of a cult drama.\ncaller: I tend to be more focused when I'm watching a movie alone, whether I'm a friend or a girlfriend, but when we're together, we go to the movies, and that's because we see the same movie, and then we see the movie, and we have the advantage of sharing stories with each other, and I often use the cinema, but when I see it alone at home, I don't invite someone to come and watch the movie with me, because it's just the two of us, and we're watching the movie together, and we talk about it, and then our concentration gets blurred, and we usually finish the movie, but that's why I use the cinema so much, because the movie is compressed in such a short amount of time, and there's so much representation, and it's nice to know that there's a lot of things that we don't know, and now we're seeing the movie in person, and I've seen a lot of other people's reviews, and I understand that a lot.\nreceiver: Yeah, I love to look for that kind of analysis after a movie. You said that you've seen a lot of superhero movies, and the characteristic of those movies is that there's a lot of hidden messages in the movie, and so when you first saw it, you didn't realize that there were a lot of those scenes hidden in the film, so there are a lot of posts on blogs or portals where people who are the movie are analyzing that there was this hidden scene, and you also said that you like the genre of noir, especially when it comes to Korean movies, there's also a lot of articles about interpreting movies, and I really like looking for that sort of analysis.\ncaller: Yeah, I've seen a lot of films, and I like to talk about what other people thought about it, and I love to talk about it back and forth, so when you're not watching a movie for Killing Time, but you're watching a movie that has some meaning, or a movie like Parasite, and you're like, \"What was the most impressive thing about this scene?\" or \"Was this not a good scene?\"\nreceiver: Yeah, I watched it at home with my family after the Parasite movie came out, and I don't really watch a lot of Korean movies because I liked the way they were so elegantly portraying what should have been in the real world, and I sympathize with the fact that Korean movies are so good at capturing that aspect, but it's actually kind of scary to me in some ways because they're so vividly depicting things that could be happening around me, but Parasite is similar, and it's kind of graphic and a little bit violent, and I was just a little bit embarrassed in my personal opinion, because I'm an annoying person, but I think the parasite material itself is really great, and it gets so many awards at film festivals, and I think the performances of Korean actors are really good, especially the supporting actors who played the main characters in Parasite, and I thought it was really good acting, and this was a really good movie that you can find a place to hide, so I think you're a big fan of Korean movies, especially if you have a Korean director by your name.\ncaller: I said that I like the genre of film noir, so in that regard, the films directed by Na Hongjin, the film that came out in 4885, the pursuer, and now there are a lot of films that came out after that, but I was a little bit more conservative, very cruel, because I saw such a brutal event so closely and deeply that it was very, I think that the director's perspective was very good. Do you have a favorite film or director?\nreceiver: I didn't have a favorite director, and now I don't even remember the actors, but I prefer actors who are a little bit better in acting. Well, everyone does, but I actually don't think about that kind of actor in Korean cinema right now, and I think I've seen a lot of films made by that foreign actor, other everyday films made by an actor from my favorite hero series, or other films made by the actor.\ncaller: I don't watch animated movies at all, and I really like the Jibril Studios series, so I've seen a lot of things like Sen and Chihiro's Gone With the Wind and Mononoke Hime, and the reason why I haven't seen them is because I don' t have that sense of reality that animation gives me, and I' m not very good at watching them.\nreceiver: Basically, I've seen a lot of the Disney movies that I think are the best when it comes to animation, and I like Disney writing a little bit, and Disney movies have a little bit of a musical element in them, and it's kind of fun and fun to keep hearing that Oreste after the movie, and think about that there was a scene in that movie, and I think I'd rather go through an animated movie and forget about reality and just enjoy a little bit in the virtual world, and that's the kind of time that I liked better, so I kind of enjoyed the animation in that way, and we're kind of having this conversation, and I feel like there's a lot of differences in our movie tastes, but I'm more of a killer-time kind of guy, so I like a movie that has a lot of musical elements in it, and I'm kind of interested in the Oreste aspect of the movie, so I don't know if you're interested in that sort of thing when you're watching that movie.\ncaller: There's a lot of famous ones, but there's also a lot of melodic ones that have a lot of background music until the beats, and I think I'm more interested in that kind of thing, so I can tell right away when the beats that are used in movies are being used for something else, or for something dramatic.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It's an application.\ncaller: So you're saying that when you take out a loan or get a credit card, the admission test increases the likelihood that you won't be able to repay the loan or the credit card in the future, and that affects your credit score?\ncaller: Uh-huh. When you're not eligible for a loan or a credit card that's been rejected by the bank.\ncaller: When you cancel because you don't need to, your score doesn't go down, it's just a credit check.\ncaller: It's not reflected in credit ratings.\ncaller: So it's only when you actually get a loan or a credit card.\ncaller: It affects your credit score, is that what you're saying?\ncaller: Do I make myself clear?\ncaller: - But why would he do that?\ncaller: Do they know that they're still going to the credit bureaus and their credit scores are going down?\ncaller: A.

I think he' s a nice guy, good at socializing, compared to what I've been doing, I want to end up like this, and I' m not very interested in people, so the fact is that I' m a first-year university student, and now I'm a second-year college student, and when we talk about something like this, I think there' s no reason to write about a guy like that, and I think it' s a bit more convenient to go to\nreceiver: The other day, I was watching a movie online with my son and my girlfriend, who I can't see anymore because they're so far away from each other, and I couldn't see them, and it was really exciting, and I was like, I mean, we're on Netflix together, and we're having this face-to-face video chat, and we watched the movie together, and I don't know how we're watching it, but I'm watching it, and so it's possible that we're in a relationship that our generation can't even think about, and it's really exciting and we think about it, but we've come to a world where it's not going to happen anymore, and so I thought, well, that's pretty exciting, but yeah, now we're just the same old generation, and now there's no more school, there's nothing to worry about, and people are meeting less and less because of the coronavirus, and I'm like, \"Oh, I just wish we weren't dating like that before, but I just wish that we were dating like that, and I just wish it wasn\ncaller: I was a little worried about my son being away from his girlfriend because he's in the army, and now I can't even get a visa, so I was a bit worried, but this time when I was on vacation, I asked him if your love life was okay, and he shrugged his shoulders like there was nothing wrong, and then he said, \"Ike\", and then he looked at me and said, \"Nowadays it's called video telephony, and it doesn't look like us, so it's not like this\". So it's a strange world, why do we want to see why we are also video telephonic with people who are so far away from us, so we all talk, so it seems that the world is different, but somehow those children don't want to be responsible for getting married and dating, and I think it's because they don't know what they want to do and don't like to live alone, and I don't think that they want to take responsibility, because I think that the voice is just not willing to come out, so I think that's why people in Japan have so many sad examples\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How can I help you?\ncaller: I'm trying to set up a short-term savings account, but can I get a wired consult?\ncaller: There are two types of short-term savings accounts, because I don't know which one is more suitable for me.\ncaller: One is called the Youth Friendship Fund, which allows you to open an account between the ages of 18 and 29.\ncaller: One is a regular short-term savings account, so I don't think there's an age restriction, but I wonder what's different.\nreceiver: Interest rates are different.\ncaller: I don't know what the interest rate is, but I wonder if it's right to calculate it based on the annual interest rate, for example, if you have deposited 10,000 yuan for a year, is it right to charge interest at a certain percentage of the 10,000 yuan base?\ncaller: Oh, so the interest rate on the Youth Savings Bond is up to 1.2% higher than other savings bonds, right?\ncaller: So if I'm 28 now, and I'm signing a two-year contract, and I have to use the product until I'm 30, can I still use the product without an age restriction?\ncaller: Or because it's a 29-year-old standard, is it automatically a 29-year old standard for products, products that are only available for one year?\nreceiver: You can be up to 30 years old as of the date you first joined.\ncaller: So you're saying that because it's a first-time membership, you can only sign up until you're 29, and then it doesn't automatically end or expire prematurely?\ncaller: Thank you for your consultation.

problem is, I think the prices have dropped a lot lately, but why haven't they dropped as much as the consumer?\ncaller: That's why, when we eat, even if we fall, it doesn't feel any different than before.\nreceiver: It's not just the overcoat, it's like all the other agricultural products or whatever, and it's cheaper in the mountains, and it goes through a lot of distribution before it gets to the artificial consumer, so it doesn't really feel like skin to us, does it?\ncaller: So it's a little bit cheaper to do that with synthetic direct trade and direct trade with the consumer.\nreceiver: I think it's a question of trust between the seller and the consumer, and I think that's what happens when you go down the road and you pass a field of truffles, and you sell truffles in front of it, and there are cases like this, and sometimes you do, but you don't really feel that it's cheap when you go there, but in the case of onions, or beans, or potatoes, or peppers in the winter, fish farmers, or whatever, we're hard to buy, and if you go ahead and go to the mountains and you buy it, and you're not sure if it's really cheap or not, it doesn't seem to be working well with each other.\ncaller: I'd like to think that it's a little bit cheaper than direct sales, but the position of the farmers is that they're selling the same thing anyway, and they want to get the same price, so I guess that's what they do.\nreceiver: But I'm a farmer, and I've been trying to grow some potatoes for a while, and it's not like I don't have hands, because there's a lot of hands, and the farmers are there, and the middlemen, the middleman merchants, they leave a lot in the distribution process, and those people have a lot of fun.\ncaller: That's right, the middlemen do that to make a lot of profit, and it's a very sad reality, because for us as consumers, even if the price drops, we hardly feel the drop.\nreceiver: It's a lot cheaper than natural shrimp, but it's probably made by us, and the big stores advertise that it's 40 or 50 times cheaper than the market because it removes the bubble in the distribution system, and it's a direct sale of shrimps, but we don't know that because we can't see the shrimp.\ncaller: It's an outfit, and it's going to be a big, big hit for the farmers, but it's something that is going to happen when the farms expand, and you see that the production is going to go up, and the producers are going to have a lot of production, and the prices are going to go down, and the consumers don't understand that, and how do we do this so that we can eat the cheap stuff, but most of the time when you think about outfits, it's expensive and it makes you think about the expensive stuff, because I grew up in the countryside, and I didn't really know much about outfits.\nreceiver: I don't know much about it, but when I came here during the Korean War, I saw that they were getting married, and their families were preparing meals, and what they were doing, so I got a fake overcoat, and then I saw my husband once, because his friend had sent me an overcoat to eat, and at that time, the overcoat was almost top-of-the-range, and I think it was very cheap, but that's something that we normally can't buy in our economy, in our household economy, at that level, and things like that are sometimes folded, but nowadays there is a lot of artificial farming, and it comes out in large quantities, but people eat more natural products than before.\ncaller: So this whole distribution structure is four-and-five-step, and it's complicated, and every time you do one step, you leave a margin there, and then another, and another, and then a margin for all five of those steps, and we don't feel that this is intuitively down to the reversal value, so it's really hard to improve one of these things.\nreceiver: I think we're going to go to a big market, or a supermarket, or a department store, and we'll get a little bit of fresh outfit, and then we'll be able to do that for a little bit cheaper, but these days, the Internet is there, and all the people who are selling these days are using the Internet to sell it, and so many of them are there, and people who are trustworthy might be able to buy a little bit more, but still cheaper, if we buy there.\ncaller: The direct trade from the mountain to the xx is something groundbreaking, because it doesn't really go through these four or five stages of distribution, and it's so cheap, so when our consumers are more skin-to-skin with it, and they're more active with it, then it would be great if the distribution and waste structure on the xx side went through these four to five stages, and the supply and waste could be improved like this.\nreceiver: All of the agricultural products, all of the aquaculture products, and all of the livestock products, and if that happens, we're going to be able to get a lot cheaper, fresh food, good food, cheaper food, and that's going to be really good for the producers, good for the consumers, but the synthetic intermediates, wholesale goods, these people are going to have a hard time, but I think that's what we need to do if we want to distribute anything.\ncaller: I'd like to see a reduction in the distribution phase, and at that point, at that stage, they're going to have a little bit less of a margin, or some kind of really comprehensive reform.\nreceiver: I think the politicians need to get their act together.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role":

You see, she's a little bit nervous, so she's always trying to stop him, and even if it's just a little bit, I think she's going to be too hard on herself, and if she's thinking about something like that, she needs a lot of help, and she'\ncaller: Well, I think it's right that there should be a profit even if we don't collect the waste, and I don't think that's part of the solution for the elderly people who collect it, whether it's the safety products or the masks, and if the problem is that there are so many elderly people collecting the waste that they can't all make $100,000 a month, then we should take a more positive approach to this and raise the disposal price, or we should put this a little bit more in the public sector or the private sector, and have a policy that allows these people to have a sustained income.\nreceiver: I didn't think about it when I was a kid, and I always think that sometimes, and sometimes now my parents tell me, I don't really know how, maybe it's because I'm not interested in that kind of thing yet, but if you think about it a little bit deeply, it's a little bit like this happens a lot, so what's the way to do a good old-age policy in a country like that, and honestly there's not a lot you can do in that country, because later on the old-age policies or my parents put me in that situation, in the real country, to survive, someone has to make a lot of money, but I think a little bit a lot of thinking, and the answer is money, so I'm a little bit worried, what do you think about our aging society?\ncaller: The reason why our country is an aging society is not just because there are a lot of elderly people in our society, it's not just because we have a lot of older people in our population, but I think that the fact that we don't have 10 or more children as a percentage of the total population is a very big problem, and it's one of the causes of aging societies. I keep hearing these days that there are many social problems in our country, that the social conditions in our country don't seem to be suitable for having children and raising them. In fact, I'm not married, and I don't even have children, but I have a nephew who is alive now, and I have another nephew who's about to be born, and I'm already worried about how I'm going to live in the future, so I think that young people don't get married again and don't want to have children either, and I think to some extent that this is the reason why we're talking about social reform and settling down first, but if we look at the overall proportion of the population, we can only see that this problem is getting harder to solve\nreceiver: I've seen my grandmother go to the kitchen a lot, and when she sees this kind of rubbish, I just wish she hadn't done it, and I think the most important thing is to get rid of it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Let me know when you're ready.\nreceiver: Just a minute.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Yes, I'll give you the case number.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: 0 5 8 8th issue\nreceiver: 0 five eight eight\ncaller: It's in Hungarian.\nreceiver: After 0588.\ncaller: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.\nreceiver: I won't.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This is the case number.\nreceiver: The ceiling?\ncaller: It's high-tech.\nreceiver: The first half.\ncaller: Crime\nreceiver: Crime\ncaller: Search team one.\nreceiver: Search team one.\ncaller: This is Detective Ichan-ho.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Before the recording, I'd like to make it clear that if you are afraid of concealing or hiding something, you are guilty of suppression of evidence under Article 155, Paragraphs 1-2, Article 152, False Testimony, and Article 132, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and we will proceed with the recording investigation right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: What's your birthday like?\nreceiver: It was July 21, 1992.\ncaller: What about your job?\nreceiver: This is a student.\ncaller: So you don't know a 40-year-old man named Kim Tae Hyun?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Have you, in the last two years, lost or stolen anything that could leak your identity, passport, wallet, cell phone, etc.?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Not in the last two years?\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Is there any truth to the fact that on October 13th, 2014 at the Chinese registry office, the National Bank of the Cooperation of Agricultural and Rural Countries opened the account directly?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We're going to proceed with the freezing of these two accounts, the Agricultural Cooperative and the National Bank, which were used in the crime.\nreceiver: What's the matter?\ncaller: Yes, freezing means disposing of waste, and you say that you didn't do this, but anyway, this is a superintendent, Kim Tae-hyun, who had worked as a supervisor at the National Bank for eight years in the past, so it was easy to steal personal information from him.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: In the SAARC, there was a total of 44.7 million yuan in illicit transactions. First of all, this is not a small amount of money, first of all, were you completely unaware that there were so many illicit transactions?\nreceiver: Of course. How does he know that?\ncaller: Do you have a receipt that you, or someone in your family, gave to a third party?\nreceiver: No, I'm in charge of the waste.\ncaller: It's all in your hands.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Let me tell you a little bit about the symbols and the uses of the financial instruments that you use. The financial instruments are the banking instruments, for example, the mortgage note, minus the principal, the deposit, the fund, the banknote that you use, do you have a banknote or a mortgage note that you use?\nreceiver: It's just that they only use one strait.\ncaller: Do you only use one banknote? Do you have any other bank notes in your name?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And the reason why I'm asking you this is because we're going to do a secondary investigation, we're gonna do a trace investigation, and in order to prevent secondary damage, we are going to investigate bank notes that are in your name, Mr. Ojukwu, and the Agriculture Department, and you said that you only have Agriculture Department. And if there's any other findings, we'll freeze them, in order to avoid secondary damage.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You said you're using the strait now, but what do you use the strait for?\nreceiver: The check card.\ncaller: You're saying that your cheque card is an easy-to-use form of payment?\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: What's the approximate amount of balance in this?\nreceiver: One hundred thousand won. Not much. That's it.\ncaller: It's less than $100,000.\nreceiver: It's not less than $100,000, I don't know.\ncaller: Other than that, there's no such thing as a housing lease. There's no cash-minus order.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The reason why I asked you this question is because you said that you have a concentration camp right now, but if we trace the sun, wouldn't it be your concentration camp? You said that it's 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, and in there, for example, whether the money is 10 million won or 20 million won, doesn't it make a lot of difference?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We'll track it down first, and if there are any additional bank issues, we'll get back to you.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You know that. Thank you for your cooperation.\nreceiver: Yeah, but, hey, what is this?\ncaller: It's not serious, are you involved with someone named Kim Tae Hyun or not?

Where are you and your family going?\ncaller: So we're trying to figure out what's going on in the country, because there's a place that my husband's company has, and we're thinking about going there as a precaution this year, and if the coronavirus hadn't been so prevalent, where would you have been traveling this year?\nreceiver: I've been wanting to go to Jeju Island since I was a kid, but I haven't been able to, so this year I really wanted to go with my family, but I don't know if I'll be able to go because the coronavirus hasn't stopped yet.\ncaller: I, uh, I have the most vivid memories of this trip that I took with my mother's handcuffs, this time with my family, because it was a trip that my mother took with her handcuffs and the whole family went together, and I had so many memories, and it was a great experience to get to know more about each other's families.\nreceiver: I'd love to go to Boracay if I get the chance, and I'd like to take my parents on a trip, but next year your dad's going to be dead, so I'd really like to go to Bali with my family. Do you have any plans to go abroad?\ncaller: I'd love to go to Europe, and I'd like to go to Paris, because there's so many things to see, and there's a lot of cultural heritage, and so I'd really like to see if there's any trip that I remember from school, or a trip to study, or a visit with my friends.\nreceiver: When I was a sophomore in high school, I went on a math trip to the Imperial Highway, but then it rained so hard that I couldn't make it to the top of the mountain, and I only got to see it on the bus, and I have many memories of that time in the hostel with my friends and playing with pillow fights.\ncaller: I'm probably the most frequent visitor to Jeju Island at school, so I was in Jeju Island, but when we were there, the IMAP went down, and I didn't have Jeju Island anymore, so I did a survey, and now I've gathered a lot of other people's opinions, and I've traveled to a place called South by Southwest, and the South Shore area, and then I came back and I did a training session with them, and I still have a lot of memories of that, and I went on that trip for almost four or five days, so I spent almost a week with my friends, and my friendship with them got better and better, so I have a picture of that time, and I look at it now, and it reminds me more and more of that time.\nreceiver: I want to go to Japan with my kid, and he's very interested in characters, and there's so many characters in Japan, and I think he's going to love it, so I want to take him to Japan and see all the characters and stuff, and I love sushi, and I want to eat sushi in Japan.\ncaller: I went on my honeymoon to Jisoo, originally I was going to go abroad, but I couldn't stay away because I had a baby in my belly, and now I'm going to Jisoe, but then we got married in June, and it rained a little, which I regret a lot, but when it rains, it rains a lot, and I've been building up some good memories.\nreceiver: I've been to Phuket on my honeymoon, and I've had massages in Phuket, I've seen performances, I'm swimming in a pool villa with my husband for six days and seven days, and it's been a great time. Can you recommend a good place to go with the kids?\ncaller: The best places to go with kids are, well, I've been to a lot of places before, and I think it's good to go to Jeju Island and Japan, because there's a lot of nature in Jeju Island, and there's also a lot of museums, and there are a lot of themed places, so it would be good to go there, and as I said before, Japan has a lot of characters, so if you like that, it would be great for the kids, so I recommend Jeju Island or Japan, if you want to go somewhere in our country.\nreceiver: If I had the chance, I'd like to go to the West Coast and pick some mussels from a sperm whale, because kids these days are playing with their smartphones more than they are playing in the dirt, and I think it would be a great experience for my child to pick some clams from that whale, and also to be able to do something with my family in that kind of nature, and it would make a great memory for my family, too, if you go on a trip between the ocean and the mountains.\ncaller: I love the ocean more than anything, and I want to go to the ocean, because the ocean makes my heart flutter, and it's a great place for kids to play in the water, and the sand is so wide, it's great for kids to go play in the sand, so I like the mountains, but I like the ocean more, so if I go to the sea, do you have any tourist attractions that you've been to that you'd like to recommend?\nreceiver: I'd like to recommend the city of Songkhla. If you go to Songkhla, you can go water skiing, you can have the Songkhla Eightfold Path, and there's also a limestone cave. It's such a popular tourist attraction, so it's great to go with your family. If you're going on a trip with your friends instead of your family, where do you want to go?\ncaller: I think it's okay to go anywhere, but unlike going with my family, my friends are really comfortable and I don't have to take care of anyone anymore, so I think any place I go with my friends is okay.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Please send it now.\ncaller: We've got a difference in our monthly payments, because we have a higher monthly payment on our savings than we have on our expenses.\ncaller: Short-term loans have lower interest rates than long-term deposits, so I think it's a little bit more helpful for people with money problems to have one long-term deposit and one short-term deposit each.\ncaller: In fact, I've looked at second mortgage deposits, and second mortgages definitely have higher interest rates than first mortgages, but I haven't figured out if they're primary mortgages or not, and I've been told that the most popular type of second mortgage is called value-added deposits.\ncaller: I wonder if there's a deposit facility in the theology bank that's worth as much as the interest rate on the deposit, including all the preferential lending terms.\ncaller: Send it to my e-mail, the same e-mail address as before, and if you have any cash products that your counselor recommends, send it to me.\ncaller: It's called a mother-in-law's savings, and it's worth less than the savings, but it's a very high rate of interest in a financial market.\ncaller: The first time you see a 30-week deposit, the first payment is $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, and that's the amount you're going to deposit every week.\ncaller: It's a fun money-raising item, so if I choose 1,000 yen next week, 2,000 yen in the third week, 3,000 yen in the last 30 weeks, then 30,000 yen.\ncaller: The base rate is reduced to 1.8% per year, but we offer a bonus of 0.2% points for automatic transfers, and if you make a successful payment every week, you get an increase in your cultural property rights when they expire.\ncaller: So the 30-week deposit is a free-float service, and it says that you can make additional deposits like free-floats, so you can make monthly deposits of up to $3,000,000, and then you can make some additional deposits.\ncaller: Like a free loan, when it expires, can it be deposited into the receivables account through automated clearing?\ncaller: What happens if you don't get an automatic transfer, where you need to have at least one-half of the total contract salary automatically transferred in order to get a bonus, so you want to make sure there's no shortage of funds?\ncaller: I want to sign up for a 30-week savings account that my advisor recommended, and I want to raise money in the short term and have fun raising money, and it feels like a very attractive commodity.\nreceiver: I'll send you another one.\ncaller: This is the first time I've seen a monthly repayment product, where the repayment effect of interest on interest is literally applied to the month instead of the year.\ncaller: Now, in a time of low interest rates like this, the payoff is less, but I think when interest is calculated and it shows up in your account, it's a strong incentive to put your money where your mouth is, like a dividend.\ncaller: You can get an interest rate of up to 3.7 percent on the lunar products you've just sent us, and you can save up to 1,500,000 yuan a month to get your money fast.\ncaller: There's a lot of buzz in the workplace these days about making $100,000,000, but if you're sitting on your back and saving $1,500,000 a month for five years, you're going to make $90,000,000.\ncaller: The interest you're going to get if you keep saving for five years with the goods you've just sent is 9 million yuan, and after three years, the total receipts are 98 million yuan.\ncaller: It's a fast-growing product, and it's a tricky one, because you have to be at least 35 years old at the time of joining, and you have to have at least six months of bank deposits and a credit or check card balance of 300,000 yuan per month linked to your account.\ncaller: The two products that you recommended to me, as a social entrepreneur, are more attractive savings products, so I'm going to compare them and sign up.\ncaller: Later, when you sign up, you'll be able to submit your name and the name of your consultant along with your email address and last name.\ncaller: I've never had so many questions, but thank you for your kind response.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I think he supported this man with the idea that he could solve the current problem quickly. I look at our country, but I don't know much about history, and if you look at our past, we really had no sanctions, it was very sad, there were some sanctions and some coercive sanctions and things like that. I'm not the generation that has experienced it yet, but that's not to say that it's not completely resolved.\nreceiver: Yeah, I think overall, since Brazil came to power in 2000, it's been a very Labor-dominated country with a very bad economy and a lot of debt in some countries, and I think this vicious cycle has been going on, and so when that Brazilian president was elected, we used to make a lot of comparisons with President Trump, and he's doing the same kind of policies now that President Trump is doing in the U.S., and I think it's almost a blur, but from the point of view of the people in the country, they're most concerned about the economy and security issues, and they have the strongest policy on that, and from the perspective of the people of the country, I think we can really trust and rely on that president, politically, and I don't have any knowledge of politics as a woman, but I think there's a lot of promises that are made that are wrong, and some of those promises are actually being implemented, and if the Brazilian government and the economy don't like it, then I think maybe the people will elect another president.\ncaller: And I don't know much about Brazil, so I'm not sure how to respond, but this president, well, how do you think he's going to save the economy with this kind of austerity, because I think he was elected with it, because the Brazilian economy was so bad that he made a commitment to it, and he got support through it, and then he said, well, didn't he calculate that he would have to fulfill that commitment and then he would be able to get re-elected again and again and again?\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

And as we were investigating, Zhu Miyuan asked us where these two illegal transactions came from and how they were used, and Zhu Miwuan said that he had paid money to buy the transaction from the person who bought it, using a ledger. So we contacted him directly to see if this was the case. What happened?\nreceiver: I don't know anything about that.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: I don't know anything about it.

So you go into the army and you start, and there's all these things, and people in the art world have to come and go to the military, and I've seen the auditions, and they've got to go into the military and now they can just come and go, and they can go and work in that field so they don't lose their functionality, and if they're very good at something, they're first in an international competition, and they get an exemption, and then they're doing a greater service to the community because they're in charge of that service, and I don't have anything to say about that, but in terms of fairness, they got an exemption from the military, so they got a little bit of a time off.\ncaller: But I've been asked to serve, and even the hours of service have been manipulated, so it's a long time, because the travel time is five hours, and you put that into the service time, and if you violate it, you can be cancelled or something like that. In fact, we do, but in order to do that, the time you actually go and do it is short, and the preparation time and the movement time and the cleaning time and the withdrawal time are the things that eat the most, but this seems a little unfair. I think it's right to put the travel time into the time of service, especially because people in the art world don't have a lot of time to prepare for it, and because they've given it an exemption, and they don't really have access to society, and they seem to be vulnerable, and they say that the sickness benefit is actually not going to the army, so will that person make a great contribution to the development of the country, and that's a question that people who are artists also ask, and then they get the soldiers wrong, and they practice, and perform, and they go to\nreceiver: Yeah, yeah, you go to the army and you serve in the military and you do national tours and you do things like that and you organize the Ming Army and you do symphonic music and so on and so forth, and I think you do a lot of volunteer work in the army, and so I think you don't have to go into the army to waste your time and not your skills, and I don't think you do, but there are some people who come out of the army and develop their skills in their field, but most of the men also have a way to prevent them from going into the army. There are some people in the army who are singers and some people who are enlisted in the army and go to all the recreational activities, and some people have finished and come back and some people are good because now the military life is shorter and the separation from society is not as deep as it used to be, so it doesn't seem like there's that much space, even if you cut back a little bit, because now you can't fish in the army or anything, you can play sports, you can fish, you can do whatever you do in the military\ncaller: And I think that's why the dancers here have reduced their service time, because they're older, and they're stronger, and so I think that art is something that's becoming more and more disproportionate to their age, and it's a job that takes up a lot of body, especially if you're in the military and you're going to get injured, and that kind of anxiety doesn't work that much, so maybe you're not avoiding it any more, and I hope that's the same for athletes, but there's something about football that gives you time to serve, and you put in travel time, and so you're even disqualified, and then you're just completely unknown and you lose your job for the rest of your life.\nreceiver: And I think it's important to have some sort of regulation, because there's always going to be some sort of problem with that, depending on the field, and it's going to take a lot of preparation time, and it may not be necessary at all, and it could be simple work in the field, for example, putting grass on a simple envelope or something that doesn't require any preparation time.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It's bad. I've been there before, and people who are worse off than me will probably be very upset when they see this article about my friends who are going into the military, and why our country shouldn't change, but it does have its advantages, but it also has a lot to learn from being in the military. Oh, men have to go into the army, you know, and I don't want to say that, but I think it's better not to be in the army, because for that time, it's actually much better to do something you want to do than to get something, but it's not just a waste of time army.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Can I help you?\ncaller: Hi, I'd like to talk to you about a deposit product, which is higher than a regular deposit, and I would like it to be a product that doesn't have a deposit protection like a fund or a trust, or a loss of cash, so I think I'm going to have to come up with some cash.\nreceiver: Please provide your name and contact information for accurate consultation.\ncaller: It's called an ELD, and it's a good product for people like me, who want their money to be a guarantee, and when they get it, they want it to be more than the interest on their deposits.\ncaller: If you subscribe for one year, and the underlying asset that you're basing on is the cost of the subscription, like the ELF, and you have a baseline price, it's easy to understand if you explain the ELF once you subscribe.\ncaller: It's the same thing as an ELF item, you sign up for it during the sale, and then the end of the last day of the sale is the subscription price. So the item that I'm showing you right now is not the item that's on sale this week, it's the item that will be on sale next week. This week's item is sold out, so it's closed early.\ncaller: It's 0.7% in the lowest year and 1.8% in the highest year.\ncaller: The structure is that if the determinant, the Cospi index, falls below 90% of the benchmark, it's 0.7%, and if it's above 90% and below 110% it's 1.8% per annum, regardless of the price of the index in the long run.\ncaller: If you look at the structure of the Sharing Index Fixed Deposit, it's very similar to the ELF structure, and it's designed to be a cash collateral.\ncaller: I think it's a good thing that they guarantee the principal, but on the other hand, if you don't meet the conditions, you're just going to get the principal.\ncaller: You can check the daily price on the Korean exchange website or you can check the price on the portal website by typing in the cost index.\ncaller: Every day, when you close a trade, you go to the site and check the volatility, and if you're in the conditional range, which means that the price of the Cospi index fluctuates between 90% and 110% of the index price, then you can get an interest rate of up to 1.8%.\ncaller: If you sign up during the sale, you're not charged interest on your subscription for a couple of days, but you're charged 0.3% interest on the amount you signed up for during the sale. I thought we weren't going to charge interest, so I thought I'd sign up on the last day, but I think it's a good idea to sign up next week because the product may be expiring.\ncaller: There's a lot of other structures, but you said that the current structure is a structure where you can see a return against the benchmark, and if you need funds, you can moderate it, but less than six months from the date of enrollment is 1% and more than six months is 0.5%.\ncaller: It's also a deposit-guaranteed loan, which means that if you need emergency funds, you can take it as a secured loan without having to go through an intermediary.\ncaller: So instead of just signing up for one product, you might want to sign up for a portion of your shares in an index-linked annuity, and the rest in a regular annuity, so it's a smart investment to diversify your portfolio of assets, or you could sign up for an accrual fund, and your money would be a safe deposit.\ncaller: So we're going to have a weekly sale right now, but we can stop the sale depending on what's going on in the market, and then we'll have a sale next week, but we don't know what the next schedule is yet.\ncaller: The structure of the Sharing Index, as explained by my advisor earlier, has an upper limit and a lower limit, but it's stable, so if the benchmark fluctuates above the upper limit or below the lower limit, there's a higher probability that you'll get the principal.\ncaller: No one knows what the market situation is, because there's so much volatility, so much risk, that it's possible to sacrifice stability to get high returns.\ncaller: You can't cancel or change anything after the sale, because it's not a sale, it's a reservation, and you can cancel or change it, but the new rule is that it's the last day of the sale.\ncaller: If you're going to keep the principal until the expiration date, you're saying that the principal is guaranteed, and if you close the account in the middle, the payment on the account may be negative depending on the change in the book value, but if you close it, you could lose the principal.\ncaller: Sharing index-linked annuities are just as safe as regular annuities, and they're a limited but tax-advantaged commodity, so I think it's one of the best commodities to look at for stability and profit, and of course, depending on market conditions, you can only get the raw money out of it, which is kind of ridiculous, but still, the raw money is a guarantee.\ncaller: I knew that you could only use a mutual fund or an ELS, which is structured like a share index-linked annuity, but I didn't, and it helped me a lot to learn about these new financial products.\ncaller: I was wondering if I should join because the interest rate on a regular deposit is less than 1%, but I really like that there's a product that guarantees the principal and also the opportunity to receive an interest rate higher than the regular deposit.\ncaller: Thank you so much for your kind response, I had a lot of questions and it was very helpful.\nreceiver: Do you have any other questions?\nreceiver: Thank you.

This is the reality of Japan, unfortunately, and I also think that if you're wrong, you have to admit it, so that even the comfort women who are living now can forget the wounds of that time and live the rest of their lives with some comfort.\ncaller: The opposite attitude is to hate Korea, and of course I also think very sadly about each other. If you say that you hate our country in another country, I think it's also because of the wrong historical knowledge that you hate the country itself. It's unfortunate, and frankly I don't regret it. Such extremist groups spread the wrong knowledge and thereby bury the country honestly. Economically, culturally, historically, and such knowledge will propagate the wrong knowledge to other children or other people, and always think that the distorted truth is actually true, and think that the other person, the entire population of the other country, hates it. If you don't like the opposite attitude, I feel it a little bit and it's a little bit unreasonable and very unfortunate. So as I said in this story, it's most important that historians have the right information based on historical facts and that the foundation should be based on the evidence and take its place in the middle of it. And now it's important for historians to think that there is no such thing and that their own children and their historical knowledge should be\nreceiver: When I think of the comfort women, I feel sorry for them because I was born in that era and I've seen so much damage, and it's such a terrible thing, and so before I die, you say you want to be forgiven and apologized, even before you freeze your eyes, and it hurts my heart, but if this Japan doesn't apologize like this and don't pay compensation, then I think I'll hate this country so much, and I think I will hate this country, but I don't want to go on with the comfort issues, because in the global era, countries and countries are interacting with each other in all economic and economic areas, and if I think about comfort issues, if I knew a grandmother who did that, then I would strongly oppose it, and that's my position, and if history is distorted, I think it's impossible for an honest person to put the word \"honest\" in Japanese, because if you give them a chance to go to Japan, they'll choose whether or not it's a historical choice.\ncaller: If I was guaranteed the opportunity to go abroad at my age, if I went abroad at the time, if I could get some kind of support in terms of cost or time, and it was specified exactly what I was going to do in Japan, and let me think about it, it would be nice to go to Japan to learn a language, and I personally love learning foreign languages, because it's nice to experience other countries, and when you meet Japanese people, you'll naturally talk about each other and your country, and if you know a little bit about history, you can also talk about your personal opinion, and you'll be able to figure out why Japanese people don't like how they think about Korea, and if that's the case, I think it's a good opportunity for me personally, so I'll definitely go to Japan if I get the chance.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I'm an EmBTI type of ICESPY, and speaking of personality, I can tell others that they don't have deep concerns about media, and people with a quick temper say that they're easy going, positive ICESPYS respond to media, and they're curious.

When I was a kid, I thought I was a little bit like my mom in character, and I said, \"Well, you know, as I get older, I think I look a lot like your dad in my values and my thoughts, and for example, when I go out with my friends like this, when we go on a group trip, my dad likes to be the one who leads the way and looks around, and he's like, 'Why don't you go out with your family, and why do you do it all by yourself?'\ncaller: I'm not in charge of the atmosphere, but I do whatever my friends want me to do, and I'm just in the group of my friends, and I get along with all my friends, so I don't have to be in charge, but I'm a good friend to a certain extent. name1 you're in a group of friends, how about you? I have no big problems with my friends, but I think I'm very stubborn, and sometimes I get in fights, and sometimes when I try to put what I like out there and my friends don't give it to me, why don't I take it and make a little bit of a compromise.\nreceiver: I've never had a big fight, but I have a friend who's not a friend type, and I think we have this kind of conflict, like when he's angry and I'm angry, but he's cool, so he forgets about it, and he comes to me, so it's very easy for me to get over it, and because I'm quick to admit that I've done something wrong, I think we've been able to come to terms with each other, and if we've had a fight, I wonder if it's because we're concerned about each other.\ncaller: Uh, do you laugh a lot among friends?\nreceiver: Yeah, I think I always laugh when I see my friends because it's so nice to meet them, and we've been friends for about 10 years, and I'm glad we're together all the time, and I wish our friendship hadn't lasted so long because we know each other so well, and we care about each other, and we sacrifice ourselves, and we give each other a little bit.\ncaller: I've only had one best friend since elementary school, and I don't think I've been able to make friends for that long, probably because of the contact issues I mentioned earlier, and so I still have that one friend, because I've taken care of her a lot and treated her well.\nreceiver: I don't seem to have a lot of friends by my standards, and I've been in a few deep relationships for a long time, and I haven't been in a lot of casual ones, so I've got a lot of these open-minded friends around me, and I can see that because of them, but I just don't feel like I have the energy to have that many friends myself.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

For example, you don't know a 38-year-old man named Kim Sun-taek, and there's no evidence that you sold Kim Sun-tak's wallet.\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: This is the first I've heard of today, and since these bills were confiscated from an illegal place, and we've paid for them, regardless of your doctor, and if we find any other bills or cards in your name besides the one you opened yourself, we'll consider them illegal bills and we'll treat them all the same.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: So, apart from the two accounts we've seized, where are the accounts you opened yourself?\nreceiver: Concentrated and devoted.\ncaller: So have you ever applied for internet banking or telebanking with any of these banks that you just mentioned?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Did you both apply?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And do you have a credit card issued to you personally?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, where do you use it?\nreceiver: It's modern.\ncaller: So let me check again, do you have a credit card that's in line with the NAFTA and do you use a modern card?\nreceiver: When you do Internet banking or mobile banking, don't you show up there?\ncaller: Yes, I'm going to tell you that I told you earlier that this case involves a banker, and since the banker is involved, the fact that the banker has opened my money order and sold it, and we've had a couple of calls, as you said, confirming the account, and when you open the money order, there's a black magnetic part on the back of the money order.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And if you skip over that part, you'll see that there's a number on the receipt, and there's baked beans, and they're being sold in a slightly altered way so that the victims don't even recognize it, and we've just been made aware of that, and I think, as you said, if you'd checked it out yourself, you'd have gotten a report.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Now, if you have a credit card that you're using right now, and you have a modern credit card, then any other credit card transaction or any other transaction that we find, we'll treat it as an illegal transaction, and we'll tell Miri, and then we'll freeze it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And we're going to start checking your accounts through the Financial Supervisory Authority today, including your three-year balance sheet, to see if you've continued to trade with Kim Jong Un.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Yes, and we're doing this to make sure that your assets are now illegal gambling funds and we'll be able to verify your liabilities, and I've been looking around today and I'm pretty sure that there should be an approximate amount of money in your bank account. I'll explain this part to you. It's not the amount that's important right now, but if you find that ridiculous amount of money compared to what you've said, it could be confiscated because we're pre-empting it.\nreceiver: There's not a lot. There's that much, and the Shinhan Bank would be similar.\ncaller: So how much of both do you have?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Combine the two. Is there any difference between a profit-taking, a depository receipt and a securities fund manager minus a separate entity?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: You don't know your assets?\nreceiver: My dad knows best.\ncaller: What you're confirming right now is that you have this and this, and you don't have any other deposits or receipts or anything like that.\nreceiver: There's probably a note.\ncaller: You have a deposit, but you don't know the amount.\nreceiver: It is now.\ncaller: It's not the deposit you requested, it's your father's, so you don't know the exact amount?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

I have curly hair and it rains all the time, and when I do that, my hair blows all over the grass, so I only come to work and go home during rainy season, and I don't want to make appointments with other friends, and I only want to be at home during the rainy seasons. Anyway, out of the twelve months of the year, I hate July the most. Sister likes any season.\ncaller: I actually like summer because summer is just more like summer than spring, and it's very green, and blue, and bluish green, and there's a little bit of rain, and you know, there's lots of people who are a little bit depressed, but I still like summer, and I like it when it rains in the fall, and it rains when I use an umbrella, and then it rains all the time, and that's why I like summer, but name1 is what I like about the season.\nreceiver: I like winter best, even though it's cold. Anyway, during the four seasons, winter is my favorite. People don't like the cold, but the cold weather and the wind and things like that. I don't really like a lot of cold, so I like winter the best, and then it's spring. Um, and then the roses, um, of course, it rains a lot, and if I'm indoors and I'm not wet in the rain, that's good, but I really hate walking around in the rain and getting wet in it.\ncaller: Why does it snow a little bit? There's an old saying, \"There's a little bit of hail, there's a hail, go to the swamp\". Old adults say that. That's what they say with my old joke, \"Some father-in-law went to a new home, and his mother-in-laws are new home, but it's so good, so it rains, so there's no hail, so there is no hail\". So they say, \"My mother-in -law is a new house, but it rains so much, so I like it when it rains a lot, and it's nice when it snows a little bit, but I like it especially in autumn, when the winter is over\". So the autumn is late, and the winter is cold, and the season is over, and I hate it so much, and I don't like the seasons, and the years are rough, and the summer is boring, and the kids don't want to be alone. I have a lot of memories of the summer, and when we go back to our mothers, there are lots of\nreceiver: I don't like summer holidays very much, I do too. Summer holidays are mostly in early August, so we always skip that season and move it to September or October and go on trips. She used to say that she hated winters the most in late September and early October, but I think that's the best time because it's cold and it's so nice, and she's lonely and lonely and things like that.\ncaller: Every person has a different preference for the seasons, so I like summer, when there's plenty of water, and it's lush and lush and lush in the mountains, and old people say that in summer there's good clothes, bad clothes, and there's no sign of poverty. Old people used to tell me that my mother also said that winter is bad, well-to-do, and the gap between the rich and the poor is certainly a good season to live without summer. It's summer because my mother always said that I like summer anyway, I like it, I can go out and sit in that valley whenever I want, or I can sit on the mountain at the bottom of the mountain with the sound of the birds and the wind, and if I sit on a table like this, it's fresh. I have nothing to do with that, because I liked summer, and people see things from different angles, and I like that season, when the beginning of winter is late and the beginning of spring is late, and I don't like to see the end of the year when it's late and the start of summer is late and I think that's a lot of\nreceiver: But I also love to eat fish in the summer, and I like to eat other summer foods, such as sweet potatoes, and then white potatoes and chicken meat, especially sweet potato, and then I eat them all, and I love them so much, and I also like watermelon, and then there's all kinds of fruits, and there's lots of fruit, like peach cobbler, and then in the summer I like to buy a carrot or something, and you can drink it like this, and it's cool, because I have a lot of heat in my body, or it's cold in my stomach, and anyway, drinks are good to drink in the summer.\ncaller: I'm a big fan of weird, weird, weird stuff, but I've been talking about this whole white house thing, and I want to put it underneath the acid and put it in the seat, and make it look like white house, and it's all white, it's gnarly, and it feels cold, and it sounds bad, and I just want to eat it, and then suddenly I want to eat white house.\nreceiver: We've never eaten it, but we'll make a plan for next time.\ncaller: When you're under the acid or the bathtub, you're supposed to open it up and eat the white house, and I'm like, \"Yeah, let's go eat that white house, I want to eat so much, but at our age, we have to eat white house, white house, or three-dimensional candy, they say it's a sight for sore eyes, and you have to see it, and, uh, people like you like to be fried because it's cold in here, so chicken is neither hot nor hot, it's right in the middle, so more people like you should eat warm food, not too hot, and eat a lot of cold food, because in the summer, you shouldn't eat too much cold food\".\nreceiver: The famous White House in downtown Busan is on the 12th, 12th and 3rd floors.\ncaller: I don't know. It's a one, two, three.\nreceiver: There's one, two, three, I'll make my own choices. First, there's the peanut butter. Second, here's a peanut butter on the side. Third, I've never eaten anything other than those two.\ncaller: In the summer, it's a triangular candy, isn't it? In the winter, our people think they'll find a lot of triangular sweets because they're warm in the winter, but deliberately in the summer, they're triangular. That's the triangular sugar, considering that triangular sweet, we've all been there, but the real triangular is actually that small, but the chicken, so you have to be triangular, that's when the chicken lays eggs and there's no nutrition, we also say that it's triangular; we say that it is triangular there, so it's basically white, let's put it in a large pressure cooker, put it in the same place and cook it for a long time.\nreceiver: I don't really like meat in water, but I think it's better than baking, and I think fried chicken tastes better than fried marshmallows in water. But I still like it, so let's go eat marshmallow, even if we don't like it, but I'm trying to make it to the end of the day tomorrow, and I'm saying that, and then I'm going to eat marshmellows with you.\ncaller: I've been waiting too long to get the sea cucumber. At least I've got the license plate. I'm always waiting for the seacucumber. It's at the back of the water department. I take the license plate and wait for it.\nreceiver: Yes, in the winter season, it's a good winter for the ducks, and the fruits are good for the seaweed, and no matter what you eat, seaweed vegetables are delicious, and last year we had seaweed on ice and we ate it together, and suddenly I don't remember the name, but this seaweed and ice and grilled it was really cool and tasty, so last year, I just didn't eat seaweed but I started to eat fish, and I made sure to eat it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Well, Mr. Name2, if a gift box fell from the sky, I'd like to know what's in it.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, I'd like to see a lump of gold fall from the sky.\ncaller: I wish there was a time machine or something, something inside that could take us back in time.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Do you know anything about this?\nreceiver: I don't know the kid.\ncaller: Then you can lend me the account.\nreceiver: There's no such thing. It's a stranger.\ncaller: Let me verify my identity first.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Once we've checked the confiscated receipts against the bank's, it's clear that you're right.\nreceiver: Is that mine?\ncaller: Yes, I'm sure, and the reason I'm calling you today is to find out if you opened the account yourself, or if you're the only one who has access to it.\nreceiver: No, I'm not open to transplants and CT scans.\ncaller: Yes, because the personal information has been leaked and now there are victims who have been defamed, I'd like to clarify that not only are there more than 200 people from all over the country involved in this case right now, but we don't know if they're actual victims or actual perpetrators, and we can't figure out if we're going to stop our financial transactions right now, because there's a possibility that our investigative information could be leaked, and now there's been so much escalation in the number of victims in the last four days, that we've called you urgently right now to prevent a second victim, and I don't think there will be a second victim.\nreceiver: What's your damage?\ncaller: So now I thought it would just be CT Bank and the foreign exchange bank, and now you're like, what are we going to do, we're going to do an investigation, and then we'll go to the financial controller, and now we'll say, if you're investigated, there's a receipt here, and there's deposits in the receipt, and everything's been written down, and this is all low, and it's all low with the balance, and I'm going to go to the Financial Controller, and they'll look at this again, and if there's no margin of error, now we can protect this part of the amount on our side, but now there's almost a lot of voice spying these days, so now we've got a lot of people asking for a subpoena, and we couldn't help but subpoena them, and every time we subpoenaed them, we said, \"Now we can't be held responsible until we've been investigated\".\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First, I'd like to ask you a few questions about whether or not I'm the perpetrator or the victim, because we're in the middle of a recording investigation.\nreceiver: It is possible.\ncaller: I'm going to ask you to speak a little louder than usual.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Is the area code 851295 correct?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Two times, right?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Do you know Kim Young-gil, a 39-year-old male?\nreceiver: No, I don't know. What's Kim's name? What's her name?\ncaller: Kim Young-gil, where are you?\nreceiver: I don't know Kim Young-gil.\ncaller: Have you ever opened a CT Bank ATM and a Foreign Exchange Bank ATM located in your dorm room in Seoul on February 18, 2014?\nreceiver: No, there isn't.\ncaller: Did you know that your account was being used in the case of Kim Jong-il's kidnapping?\nreceiver: No, I didn't know.\ncaller: Now, because these officers were seized in an illegal location, whether they opened it themselves or they had help, they've already been frozen, and you know what that means.\nreceiver: No, tell me about it.\ncaller: It means stop using, stop paying, stop disposing of. Once this is done, once you're aware of this, and tell me what's going on with the banks that you're using now other than Citibank and Foreign Bank, the reason we're asking you right now is that if you haven't opened it yourself, we're going to take it to an illegal broker and freeze it right now.\nreceiver: Oh, so you've frozen everything I'm using other than the controls?\ncaller: Yeah, so if you want to get rid of the Human account now, you can keep quiet.\nreceiver: The bank we're using is Shinhan Bank.\ncaller: So you don't mind if we freeze everything but the newborn?\nreceiver: Well, as far as I can remember, I use a state-owned bank.\ncaller: Yeah, it's not a state bank, but it's got a cash register right here.\nreceiver: That's the way.\ncaller: There's a lot of them.\nreceiver: You can just tell me the bank.\ncaller: Yeah, well, I'm not the one asking.\nreceiver: There's only Shinhan Bank.\ncaller: There's only one bank, Shinhan Bank, and they're using Internet banking right now.\nreceiver: Yes, I'm using it.\ncaller: How many of these accounts have you opened yourself?\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: There are four Shinhan banks, and not Shinhan Bank, but there are three or four of them in this account, so I asked him how many accounts he opened himself.\nreceiver: Are you a new bank now?\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: I think there's about one or four of them.\ncaller: There's no point in freezing the rest of it except for these four.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So, without further ado, as I said before, I'm going to start by telling you the purpose of each of these.\nreceiver: It's a salary receipt, it's a check-in receipt, a check-out receipt, and it's the kind of receipt where you get points back.\ncaller: I know.\nreceiver: Yeah, that's all I have right now.\ncaller: If you have two inputs and one out, you have one left, right?\nreceiver: Withdrawals payroll withdrawals one three dogs and just that one point\ncaller: There's no such thing as a separate entry fee.\nreceiver: It's not relevant.\ncaller: And the reason why I'm asking this is because, as I said before, if the margin of error is too large, we're going to have to be considered illegal intermediaries.\nreceiver: I can't confirm that right now.\ncaller: So it's accurate, so if it's 500,000, if it is 450,000, there's 500,000 of them, and even then, because we don't freeze them that easily, they're all disposable, so we have to be very careful.\nreceiver: Do we have to keep making long phone calls?\ncaller: If you hang up right now, you're gonna have to keep calling me back.\nreceiver: Where are you?\ncaller: This is Kim Hyun-sik, head of the South Seoul District Securities Bureau.\nreceiver: What about Kim Hyun-sik?\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: Where in the world are you?\ncaller: This is Seoul. Seoul. So, what I'm going to talk about right now is being interrupted and recorded right now, right?\nreceiver: Yeah, I've been recording too.\ncaller: Yeah, I'm recording right now, and no one can hear your voice, and you're the only one who can talk to me right now, so if you stop here, you're gonna have to do it again, okay?\nreceiver: Can you text me the name and number of the police station in your area, and I'll call you after work?\ncaller: What happens at the end of the day?\nreceiver: I think it'll take an hour or two.\ncaller: We have a curfew, so that's about 3:30.\nreceiver: Wouldn't somebody else do that for you?\ncaller: But since I'm in charge of it, can I give you someone else's number?\nreceiver: No, leave your number and something else, and I'll call you back.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

After a visit to the Financial Supervisor in the middle of Friday, you will sign the account tracking complaint file and, with the approval of the Director of the Financial Supervision Authority, you will also sign the second and third claims for property insurance.

It's a Mascom term that refers to a temporary restraining order.\nreceiver: I've never heard of it.\ncaller: Do you know what that means? We report to the news, we report to the press, and this is called an embargo in the Mascom language.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This means that if it's passed on to a third party, you could be the first person to pass it on, and you'll be spared, and you have to understand that Mr. Bakhtamin will be under investigation for the rest of the day, and he'll have to comply with the embargo.\nreceiver: I warn you.\ncaller: Move on to the next warrant.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This is the warrant you're about to receive.

In the second case, the contents of the property situation that you have stated to the clerk responsible in the first place are being prepared by the Financial Supervisory Authority. caller: What will be the judgment of the Financial Supervision Authority if these two cases are excessive?\nreceiver: What's going on?\ncaller: If there's any additional suspicion of the existence of property theft or illegal account opening, the statement will be deemed not to be credible, in which case the warrant will be executed as a matter of principle.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Except for the two things above, and if you're acting out of spite, or you're refusing to cooperate, the warrant will not be executed, unless you understand and actively follow the procedure that I've instructed you to follow, which is based on your public statement, that you can be identified as a victim without prejudice.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: If the warrant is executed, he will be held for 48 hours in a detention center in Seoul.\nreceiver: For 48 hours?\ncaller: You're not going to be interrogated for 48 hours for two days straight, you're going to be detained for one or two hours a day for at least a month, up to two months, and when the investigation is over, you'll be admitted to court as a victim.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: And when you're on probation, you're left with a criminal record that's separate from the victim's testimony.\nreceiver: What's your record?\ncaller: And it's not like a criminal record that's going to stay with you for the rest of your life, but it's like a badge that will follow you around for years to come, and it's bound to have an adverse effect on you when you leave, whether you're in your current job or you're out of your current job.\nreceiver: Yes, I will.\ncaller: The deadline for Mr. Batum's arraignment is 4:00 p.m. on Friday, and the defendant must be arraigned by 4:00.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And finally, we're going to talk about our bank account.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This is our bank's transaction log in your name, used in this case. Please let us know if you're identified on the client's depositor's statement.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So far, we've unlocked Extension 1 Hogan, and from now on, the Cyber Investigation Unit is going to do a one-time scan of your phone.\nreceiver: Why the cell phone?\ncaller: The intent of the censorship is to see if there is any evidence that Mr. Park has had any contact with the Kim Sang-ho factions in the past, whether malicious code has been planted, and whether the right to free speech has been observed during the day on Friday, and all of these things, and all cell phone records will be tracked and screen-recorded until the victim is admitted on Friday.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Now, I'm not saying that you shouldn't use your phone at all, but if you have a business or personal emergency, you can let me know first, and then I'll figure it out and give you some time, and then you can use your phone.\nreceiver: Yes, I got it.\ncaller: We're going to be censored by the Cyber Investigation Unit, so please don't turn off your cell phone.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Now that you're connected, before I censor you, do you think there's a similarly convenient financial wallet app to Toss?\nreceiver: Yes, there is.\ncaller: If you have a convenience wallet app, delete it, because there might be some confusion.\nreceiver: Yes, I will delete it.\ncaller: Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions, but don't answer right away, just think about it and answer.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Where do you think your personal information was leaked from?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Have you ever been asked to log in from abroad?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: Or do you have a history of storing personal information in your photo slips?\nreceiver: There is.\ncaller: Have you ever accessed a bootleg site or an illegal porn site? / Do you have any illegal videos stored on your phone?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: If you'd like to make a one-time visit to the Financial Supervisory Authority on Friday, what time is it?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: I'm going to give the Cyber Corps time to withdraw once the primary review is complete.\nreceiver: I don't know yet.\ncaller: I'm on duty, so I'll give you a heads-up when you leave.\nreceiver: Yes, I remember.\ncaller: What's your excuse for quitting, irresponsibly saying you have to leave because of a coroner's inquest?\nreceiver: What can I say?\ncaller: As I explained earlier, because it's an embargo case, you can't say anything, and it's best to say that you've got some urgent business at home, and you're taking a leave of absence because of it.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yes, you can resign, resign, and when you're done with the victim proof, we'll send the paperwork to the company that you resigned by cooperating with our investigation, so that we can explain everything to you without prejudice to you. Don't worry, we will continue the investigation.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.\ncaller: First of all, we've been getting a lot of calls from the FCA about Mr. Pak's disappearance.\nreceiver: What's that?\ncaller: When you made your initial statement, you didn't make it in writing, and I'm confused because there are a lot of omissions from the FSA right now.\nreceiver: I think I've said it all.\ncaller: Now, in addition, I'm going to check the accounts first, and if there's nothing else, I'll go to the CFO, and if you have any thoughts about missing accounts, tell me now.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Once you've done that, you're done, and you're in your car, and if you're not in your car you're going to be alone at home, or you'll go to a motel room, turn off your cell phone, turn off the Bluetooth.\nreceiver: I have a car. I live with my family.\ncaller: If there's an accommodation nearby, you'll go there and get an additional statement first, and once you're there, check in before you go in.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: And it's a one-day co-operation fee, so from 00:00 on Friday until the victim's receipt is complete, when Mr. Bakhtamin spends money on car, restaurant and other expenses, you attach a receipt and submit it, and if you submit it, we'll pay you everything.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: After entering the hostel, the newly appointed security guard telephoned the hostel's name, room number and address to the cybernetic unit. The account information is executed, the authorized certificate is logged into the account at a glance, and the credit card is at a sight.\ncaller: Didn't I tell you earlier that if you have a lot of misses, you're switching to the principle! Why did you miss it? Was that a joke?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: You're such a good-looking, smart mother-in-law that you've missed a public speech because you didn't understand it? Correct your language first. Am I your attorney or was the statement a joke? If so, you'll be investigated on principle.\nWhy didn't you say so when you were asked to give a statement to the Financial Times?\ncaller: You'll be detained and questioned according to the rules, and then you'll be transported to Gyeonggi-do and taken to the Seoul Detention Center for questioning.\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: I'll call the financial controller and give you a chance to explain yourself about the loss.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'll give it a shot.\ncaller: Do you know what an auditor does in the first place?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you're rejected by the F.D.A., I'm going to have to reinstate the warrant, so you're gonna have to explain your absence and somehow qualify as a pharmaceutical investigator.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Obviously, the financial regulators are going to be sensitive, they're not going to be nice to you, so don't respond emotionally, and if you hear harsh words, put them aside, because what you need is not a pharmaceutical ego.\nreceiver: Yes, I will be careful.\ncaller: Do you know the CFO's number?\nreceiver: Visit the Treasurer's office and get an explanation, or if you're contacted by your agent or your supervisor, you can have an explanation.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Thank you. So income doesn't necessarily mean earned income, does it? I'm talking about the current possible income. So is it possible to have a pre-tax loan even with existing loans?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: We're newlyweds, and we have a mortgage, and we're told that he/she has an annual income of $70,000,000, is that true?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Could it be that if you earn more than that, you don't qualify for a stepping stone loan?\nreceiver: The eligibility criteria are specified, and if you don't meet them, the stepping stone is invalid.\ncaller: Yeah, so we can't have a threshold loan, can we just have a general line of credit?\nreceiver: Yes, it is possible.\ncaller: What's the interest rate? Is it possible to know exactly what the interest rate is in today's currency?\nreceiver: We need to do an examination.\ncaller: Do banks have different eligibility requirements, interest rates, and so on?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So you don't know what's available at every bank just by looking at it.\ncaller: So what is there to know about a phone call? Are there rough terms or guidelines, or is there a whole tax credit sequence after you've identified the house?\nreceiver: Yes, you can apply after you've checked out the house.\ncaller: Well, I've heard that when I look at the 200,000,000,000,000,000/2,000,000,000 full sets, the maximum is 80%/80%, but could it be smaller than this?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Do I have to wait more than one month for a normal trial? We may have to move quickly because we want to know how long the trial is going to take. If it's too long, it might not fit the schedule.\nreceiver: You can imagine that.\ncaller: Do you repay the principal with interest in the middle, or do you pay the principal later?\nreceiver: Two years over this year, that's the payback.\ncaller: So, what if we extend the contract? If we only have to pay it back, we won't be able to extend it. If we have a problem with our credit rating, if we don't have a problem, can we extend it?\nreceiver: Yes, it does.\ncaller: The other banks that I've looked at, when they extend, do they have a 10 percent or 10 percent reimbursement clause?\nreceiver: There's no such condition.\ncaller: Could that be so bad that it can't be extended?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So if you get a pre-tax loan, whose account does it go to, or is it the borrower's account?\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: Are you the owner's manager?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: When you renew your contract after two years, is there any chance that the interest rate will go up?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Oh, yeah.

It's kind of a childish idea, but it's a little bit of a personality, or a personality or something like that, but I'm not sure if it's just for fun, but if that's only in Japan and Korea, well, I think it's funny, I think that's what I think.

part.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: On the part of the financial supervisor of that office,\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Because of our privacy laws, we never ask or demand your personal information.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, you don't have to worry about that.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Now, if you look at the recent events, there's a lot of problems with banks.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: You know about the last one, the one in 2013 where the strait was breached.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And as I mentioned earlier,\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And do you know about the National Bank National Bank card data leak?\nreceiver: Yeah, there was a national bank.\ncaller: As a result of these incidents, the personal information of many people has been leaked and some of them have been harmed to this day, but in the current situation, you are being investigated as an investigator, not a victim or a perpetrator, so for all the financial instruments that you have used, for a while, the Financial Supervisory Authority will track your account through the tracking of all financial instruments you use, whether it's in your trading area, to identify all the flows of funds as much as possible in order to adopt accurate evidence.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And also, in this particular credit card case, I know you've done some banking transactions yourself, but we had seven offenders last week, and four of them were bad bank employees.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: According to our employees, when you go to a bank and you open your wallet or your card, you see that all of your personal information is registered in your wallet.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Yeah, I'm also going to use a card or a wallet, and I'm going to use that wallet now, because you're going to run out of pages.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So when you go to a bank and you get a new bill, you'll see that you have a black ribbon on the back of your old bill, and the bank staff will put it on the back and give it back to you.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Inside the black-threaded tape, you'll find the most important personal information about yourself that the average person can't verify with the naked eye.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yes, it's impossible for the average person to see with the naked eye, but experts can now see with the computer.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You look at this, and I call it a magnetic name, and you look at the code inside the magnetic number, and you call it the magnetic numbers.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Magnetic cards are identical, no matter which financial institution in Korea you open an account in my name, they're all identical.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: The bad bank employees, at least according to the contents, used mostly resident registry copies or magnetics to illegally open an overdraft without their knowledge, and then illegally and illegally settled out of court, and received a substantial amount for the sale of the overdraft.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: We've been having a lot of problems with the banking system lately, so we're looking at the employees of the banks, the employees of those banks that you've been dealing with.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Yeah, because there's still an insider who's on the job at every bank, every credit card company, every insurance company.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: As far as the financial sector is concerned, we're conducting an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: We're conducting an investigation to determine the identity of the insider.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And especially in the case of credit cards, if your personal information is leaked, well, criminals can use your personal information to disguise themselves as your fake identity, and then they're able to scam you with an ARS, and now you can call the card company and get a credit card loan as if you were your real identity.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: When it comes down to it, you're the one who ultimately avoids it, aren't you?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: That's why, for example, if you have a credit card, you're using several credit cards right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, you need to call your credit card company after a while, and then you have to call them yourself, and then first of all, yes, you have to have a credit card loan consultation.\nreceiver: You need to see a doctor. Now?\ncaller: Yes, yes, I've had counseling.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: For example, if you have a credit card loan of $5 million or more that you can borrow now, then you're going to have to put that money in your wallet as soon as you take out the loan.\nreceiver: Oh, please.\ncaller: Because if you're being used by criminals to take out a loan in your name, you're the one who's going to pay for it later, so the first thing that's important is that when you're talking to the credit card company, you talk to the counselor, and yes, the counselor talks to some of the staff.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You'll want to check very carefully to see if this man has disclosed his identity.\nreceiver: Would you like to make a recording?\ncaller: Yeah, yeah, because if you've seen me lately, or if you're in this office, I'm a who's who in some department, and I'm going to introduce myself, and then I'll explain what's going on in your case.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: When you call the card company in a few minutes, make sure you give your name or not.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: If you're going to say it, just leave a note and tell me, and if you don't, don't ask me what your name is, because you know what I'm talking about.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: If you don't tell me your name, then yes, if you tell me that you're not my name, then I'm going to use this phone, this phone, and this call log to conduct an internal investigation into this employee in order to ascertain the details of the employee's identity.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You know what I'm talking about.\nreceiver: I don't know how to get a credit card right now.\ncaller: You said that you've been using Modern Cards for a long time now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Modern cards and so yes one card and then do you mostly use modern cards? or do you use one card more?\nreceiver: We're using it in a similar way, but we're using one card more.\ncaller: Yeah, well, you're holding one now, right?\nreceiver: I'm in the car right now.\ncaller: Well, if you look at the cards,\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: There's got to be a phone number for the credit card company.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, yeah\ncaller: I need you to call and tell me that you've got a credit card loan and you're about to get a credit card.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'd like to know what that maximum is.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: If the maximum is over five million, you can take out a credit card loan and ask to deposit it in your wallet.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And if you get a credit card loan, you're going to have to pay interest on the money.\nreceiver: Yes, there will be costs.\ncaller: You don't have to worry about the tax or the monetary part of it, because it's not money that you received for your personal use.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Whether it's this or that, the financial part of the case is settled by our financial supervisor, and you're a proven victim.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: As for this part, yes, I'm going to put it in the form of a deposit with the Financial Supervisory Authority, and I'll arrange for a full-scale recovery.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So you don't have to worry about the interest or the financial part of it, just ask them what the maximum limit is for a credit card loan, and if the maximum is over five million dollars, then you can have the maximum limit deposited in your wallet once you get the loan, you know?\nreceiver: Yeah, yeah, I got a credit card. If I got five million dollars, I got it back.\ncaller: If it's more than five million,\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Let's see if we can figure out what the maximum limit is.\nreceiver: A maximum of\ncaller: If the maximum limit is 10 million dollars, for example, then you have to accept the maximum limit, and if you're a bad employee, you're probably going to ask yourself, \"What do you want to use the funds for?\"\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you ever ask me that, I'm sure you'll say anything.\nreceiver: Oh, well, can't the store just go ahead and do that?\ncaller: Yes, you're going to need a lot of money to start your own business, and you've taken out a loan, so you'll be able to keep up your acting.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Most importantly, make sure you don't reveal your identity.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So this is a bad employee, and if you're an employee of an employee, you can't go over to the induction questions, you know what I mean?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: And then you call that card company right now, and you call them, and you check it out, and if it's over five million dollars, then you can borrow up to the limit, and you can put it in your wallet.\nreceiver: Oh, that Esquire one. Esquire is now getting out of the Yes Bank and using a lot of Esquire cards.\ncaller: So in the case of a Hyundai, a lottery, or a national card,\nreceiver: The people are getting out of Busan Bank, Lotte, Lotte is our bank, Hyundai is Busan Bank.\ncaller: Oh, I've got to call one of the card companies right now to get one of those cards.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First, I'm going to apply for a loan, and then I'm gonna submit some documents about myself to that financial supervisor.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: And then later, and then later, I'm going to track the account for a while.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I'll call you back in five or ten minutes.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, if I could just call and get a loan right now and get the money straight to the cashier.\ncaller: Yes, you can take it as your own.\nreceiver: Let me get this straight.\ncaller: Yes, yes, and absolutely no comment on the facts of the case, okay?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, yeah, I'll call you back in five to ten minutes.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

The recent drop in garbage prices in Seoul has reduced the income earned from garbage collection and made it difficult to meet the costs of food and medical care for the elderly.\nreceiver: I've seen a lot of elderly people walking down the streets or underneath their houses collecting rubbish, mainly in Rierka, every year, and I was so small that I thought it was amazing to see them pulling such a small amount of rubbish and I felt a sense of compassion, and I saw many elderly people who are weak or have poor energy and often fall over, so I helped them every time, but I didn't like it. After seeing the article on clothing, I was really sick even more, even though they collect so much rubbish.\ncaller: Yes, I think we need this policy in the Great War as well, not only the Great War, but our country is in a very difficult situation because of the aging, and it's not the first thing for the elderly to get a job, they want to go, if you give them such a job, whether it's simple service or payment or guidance, they will have a livelihood, and besides the money they receive as a basic income, there will be money for other livelihoods, so life will be much richer.\nreceiver: First of all, if you look at the rubbish, you can see that there are a lot of rickshaws on the streets, and when you see these things, you naturally think about safety issues, so we think that we need to work with private companies to provide safety equipment, such as outdoor jackets, outdoor band masks, etc., and install traffic safety facilities around the antique stores that sell rubbish. And we also think that there is a need for traffic safety education for elderly people who collect this kind of waste to prevent accidents.\ncaller: I don't think people like us can help these people with a lot of help, but I think people who are in high places in Congress or in government agencies can help, as we said before, whether it's job support, or helping with a hobby you want to pursue, or helping you get a degree, if you have support, you can make sure that the elderly don't have to pick up enough garbage to get the money they need to make a living doing their activities.\nreceiver: Well, I think our country should include these measures to make our tax dollars more useful. First of all, the measures for the elderly in our country have not been activated that much in our time of crisis. I think we should also increase the number of measures for elderly people. I think that we should also improve the system to verify whether elderly people who live alone are safe at home.\ncaller: I think that's what I'd like to see, not just jobs like that, but a lot of care services for older people to make sure they're staying at home, and transportation subsidies, and in many places, the government to give a lot of support to the single elderly, or the elderly in general.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It's 200,000,000 over 200 million, right?

Real estate policy, as I said before, seems to be very difficult, because if you put it this way on one side, the other side is weak, and yes, if you add some regulation, then the economy doesn't circulate, and if you push this side like a squirrel's wheel, it doesn't turn this way, and this is why, for example, some of the same circles are not just like rugby parks, and there's such an unbalanced exchange of giants.\ncaller: I've seen that article too, but I'd like to see that area converted into rental housing.

And it was really fun. Chung Yi was the 3000-meter runner, and I didn't really know how this Chung was going to do it, and we ended up winning, and I really think our athletes are great. I think who is the best in the women's 3000-meter short track final at the Winter Olympics?\ncaller: I watched the game on TV, and I saw the story about the athletes who worked so hard to win the first place in the Olympic record and win a ticket to the final, and when I watched on TV, there were many athletes, and at the end of the game, I saw Sim Seok-hee running hard and doing the reverse, and then she ran hard and won the second place and became the first.\nreceiver: I used to go to the rink a lot when I was a kid, but it wasn't speed skating, it was figure skating, and it was very difficult, so it's really amazing to see athletes running on the ice like this, especially on the short track, where they're just going to fall in front of people, and then they're not even scared, but I think about it, and sometimes they get caught in their feet, and they're all jumping together like the guys who fell this time, and I'm so worried that they're going to hurt themselves, but this guy fell, but he got up quickly, and he's back in the race, and beyond that, everyone's there, and his pace hasn't slowed down, and we're all working harder together, and we set a new world record.\ncaller: When I watched the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea, there were a lot of Korean athletes, and they came and cheered hard. In the evening, all my friends gathered together and watched the game. At first, when Reuben lost his center and fell, we all fasted, and then I remember watching the athletes run hard again, not giving up and cheering hard. When we fell, it was very sad, but I think it was very touching to see how they worked hard and finally saw a team that performed well and did not give up until the end.\nreceiver: I remember him very well, how cool he was skating when the last Baquin was about to leave, and he was doing a really cool reverse climb, and he used to go inside the short track, and he would go outside and beat everyone, and he had a lot of time to make up the difference, and cross the finish line. He was very young, how good he was, and I couldn't stop cheering even when I saw him on TV, because usually the players were turning corners, and they were slowing down the coring, and they would run over each other, or they would fall down, and then they would run faster, even though they were much more exhausted.\ncaller: I'm not so interested in the Olympics, so I don't know exactly when the next Winter Olympics will be held, but in our country, the one that was held in Pyeongchang in 2018 has been an issue since the selection, so I watched it a lot on TV, so when I did the PyeongChang Olympics, I worked hard, and after that, it's hard to know exactly where the other Olympics will take place, and I guess I haven't looked back since then.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

The distribution industry is more fragmented than ever, and the baking industry has dominated this market for several years. New specialty coffee shops, hotels, and convenience stores have combined to create this sweet and deadly cake war. The keyword that dominates the annual cake revolution has become as vivid as you are. This time, the cake is not a food to celebrate by lighting candles, but rather a food to be celebrated with the spread of image-based social media, such as Instagram, which has dramatically increased the visual effects of the book.\nreceiver: Yes, I've had the experience of making these cakes as well, especially in the past few years, when I've ordered cakes that have been decorated with lettering or colored colors by customization. The market for these cakes is very developed, because I hope it's not too expensive, which means psychological satisfaction in comparison to the price, and also because of this, there is a consumer trend that neglects the consumption of discounting. Discounting is a small but discounted happiness.\ncaller: I've been thinking about it, too, and I think it would feel really good to get a cute cake for my birthday, and my friends loved it when I did that, and it's a bit of a fad these days to pick up a cake and upload it to Essence, because on Essence, you post a lot of things that you like, and if there's something cute in there, you feel good, so you upload a lot.\nreceiver: Yeah, I've had that experience, but I've also had the experience of buying a cake that was made to order and decorated with that character, rather than buying one of these pre-release character cakes, I bought a cake that had been custom-made and then decorated by that character, and I drew a caricature of Carrick as my parents for my parents' birthday, and I gave it to them, and they loved it so much, and even after all these years, they still talk about it, and it's become a really memorable memory, and it made me think that cake doesn't necessarily have to be a function of flavor, but it's a way to celebrate this day, to remember this day, and especially when I hear that I can give the person who's giving the cake their own experience as well, and I think it's great, and I also think what do you think?\ncaller: I also think that the cake has to be really visually beautiful, and I think there's a lot of different ways that you can use the cake to change the mood, like, for example, when you turn the camera down to surprise someone on their birthday, and then the cake comes out and lights up the mood, and I've seen a lot of cases where the cake has the ability to switch the mood all at once, like that.\nreceiver: So, I think that Christmas can be celebrated just by having a cake on the table that is in the right mood, and I think that this cake plays a very important role in the fact that Christmas is not really a big deal, but it's a time for families to get together and look back at the year, and look back on the year and share the fruits of the harvest, but I think that we shouldn't have this kind of vicious consumption, where we lower the quality and the price is higher, and if there's a psychological benefit before the price or quality, we should change our consumption patterns a little bit, where we open our wallets without hesitation.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Can we do that here?\ncaller: Oh, I'll have to apply for a re-issue, so I can just type in the card number, and then I'll hit instant payment again, and it won't bother me.\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: Oh, you're just going to keep the old information and get a credit card? That's fine. Well, if that's what you're talking about, you should apply for a reissue now.\nreceiver: Yes, please identify yourself.\nreceiver: Give me your address.\ncaller: \"Your love is nine happiest hours on Opacity, 40 blocks from Fifth Avenue.\nreceiver: We're ready to ship in a day or two.\ncaller: Yes, thank you. And the barcode on this app card is also a problem, because sometimes it doesn't capture well, and if you delete the cash advance barcode, how do you access the cash advance version of the app card?\nreceiver: It's not that hard.\ncaller: Oh, so once you touch the barcodes, they get bigger? I didn't know that until now.\ncaller: And even if you delete the barcode, you can still access the cash voucher details that were issued with the barcode on your home tax return, and if you delete it like I did, you can re-register it on your app card?\ncaller: It's simple. Is there a limit to how much you can use an app card, like a physical card?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Is a traditional cash advance the same as a plastic card?\nreceiver: Yes, but there's something else.\ncaller: The cashback barcode, the mobile card number that's registered on the app card, is issued with a different number than the existing cashback plastic card number, but the contents are automatically aggregated, right?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: And just one last question, why is it that the last time you selected the Authentication Request field, a credit card checkbox was generated for you?\nreceiver: Because the authentication service can only be accessed through that window.\ncaller: Right.

What's my interest rate going to be? I'm only borrowing 150, so I think it's going to be a little bit of a problem if the interest rate is high.\nreceiver: I did a personal survey, and it came up with a yearly percentage.\ncaller: Well, it's not bad, but it doesn't have to be a cash machine, right?\ncaller: Oh, really? I thought I had to have an automatic withdrawal, so I could apply on the website and on my mobile phone using my name, my cell phone, or my fingerprints, and it would still be deposited into my account.\ncaller: So what do you do?

So let's do the vacation thing, and when you have a deposit, let's have it automatically transferred from your checking account, because when you move in, there's a sharing bank near your house, and it's close, and the information is secure, and you want to use the sharing bank a lot.\nreceiver: I've relieved you of your resting process.\ncaller: I'm going to ask you to explain to me what a deposit is.\ncaller: There were 13 different types of savings.\ncaller: Except for the fact that he's holding the deed in another bank.\ncaller: I'd like to get my money's worth.\ncaller: It's the best commodity when you take into account all the interest, all the benefits, all the perks.\nreceiver: How long do you think your membership will last?\ncaller: Because it's not a short-term savings account, and the longer the subscription, the better the interest rate, and I'm thinking about a one-year credit, and six months is too short, and I don't feel like saving.\nreceiver: How about this?\ncaller: I've heard from a friend that it's a good idea to have a savings account. Is it a good savings account for an employee? What's the annual interest rate?\nreceiver: It's 4.20 percent a year.\ncaller: The interest rate is good. Is the term 12 months?\ncaller: You said it's the top interest rate, but is there a difference between the two? Isn't it 4.20% from the first month of deposit?\nreceiver: No, it doesn't.\ncaller: So if you make a deposit and when does the prime rate apply? It doesn't make sense to go to the end of the month and apply a 4.20% interest rate. I'll explain in detail how the interest rate goes up after a few months.\nreceiver: It applies to your three-month unit.\ncaller: So when you sign up and make your first deposit, the basic interest rate applies, what's the base interest rate, and how much does the premium interest rate accrue every three months?\nreceiver: It's like this.\ncaller: So if I sign up in April and make a deposit, then from April to June, I get 1.20% per year.\ncaller: It's the interest rate.\ncaller: Starting in July,\ncaller: It's not over until September.\ncaller: It's going to be 2.20%.\ncaller: Starting in October\ncaller: By the end of November,\ncaller: 3.20% per year and then 4.20% per year, which is the maximum interest rate from January to April of the next year, until it expires.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So if the interest rate is compounded, the coupon rate applies, but if it's a partnership, it doesn't apply?\ncaller: So, once you start linking up, you don't have to pay interest until you're done?\nreceiver: No, the three-month accrual rate applies.\ncaller: Even if it's in the middle.\ncaller: If you have more than three months of salary,\ncaller: Interest rates are going up. I'm glad. Of course, it's not going to be a partnership, but I was just wondering. So I'm going to sign up for that Sharing First Salary Challenge savings plan. But do I have to sign up by phone?\ncaller: Let me ask you one more question. When you sign up for a new account, there's something you have to deposit first. What is the new account? What's the maximum new account?\nreceiver: The new amount is at least 1,000 yuan and up to 1 million yuan.\ncaller: So let's say I put in a million dollars at the beginning, and then I set it to go out 100,000 dollars on the automatic withdrawal date, so I have some extra money.\ncaller: I'm trying to save as much as I can because I don't have any money to spend.\ncaller: You're saying it's okay to set up an automatic transfer of 700,000 yuan on the fifth day of the month, deposit 100,000 yuan on the 15th day, deposit 50,000 yuan on the 25th day?\ncaller: So I'm going to have to do a lot of small savings, because I don't have a fund or a stock.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: Do you have any further questions?\ncaller: No, I've had a lot of questions about my first down payment, so thank you for your kind and detailed explanation of the question, have a nice day.\nreceiver: Thank you.

I mean, I think he's so respectful that he said, \"If you don't have a headache the next day, it's not a drink\". That's what he said.\ncaller: It's just that I'm a little bit of a fan of those movies, but I'm kind of into them, and then there's this whole Essex movie thing, you know, it's kind of like a big blockbuster thing, and I feel like I should be a little bit more fun, and I've seen this movie lately, and I don't think it's been a big hit before, but it's called Pacific Rim, and it's about these monsters coming out of the ocean and fighting giant robots.\nreceiver: Well, I haven't seen it either. I don't think we're in the same league with the movie world. It's not what I see with my eyes, it's more fun. People have to be good at acting.\ncaller: When I'm choosing a movie, it doesn't really matter what genre it is, to be honest. It's just something that I don't always cover. I like to look at it first when my favorite actors come out. For example, there's the one from the Taza tribe. They've been cursed a lot. But there's that one from there.\nreceiver: I've only seen men's movies like that, and now I've seen Gangnam 1970 and it's called Immigration, and I didn't like my Immigration so much when I saw it, I fell in love with it, the movie is a little long, it's over two hours, but let's forget about it, so not like that, now a little bit ugly, Beauty Inside look at it, because I thought it wasn't funny at first, but then I see Han Hye-hwa is too pretty, look at her once, she's crazy, she is adorable, why don't you look at it\ncaller: I've seen some movies with pretty girls, but I didn't say that it doesn't matter. I've also seen Beauty and the Beast. I don't know what to say. I'm a little bitchy.\nreceiver: Yes, it's very stimulating, but if this is also stimulating then it's a little bit, because there's a lot of Briog stuff on YouTube lately, but I know that Little Forest with the Ryujun series and Kim Thali, that's a very healing movie, watch it again, because I'm watching a movie right now, I'm just watching YouTube, and I like healing very much.\ncaller: I've seen Little Forest, too, but it's a documentary. It's a war film. I know, it's that movie with the cow. That movie and I liked that movie a lot, and it was very popular, and I watched that movie called the cow, and I saw the movie with the cows, and I thought, well, this is the kind of thing that really makes people feel creative, even in this kind of thing.\nreceiver: I don't know if it's because I watched it when I was a kid, but there's a movie called The Boatman, and it's the scene where a guy in a helicopter hands a watch to a guy and he falls off, and you know, that's where I got fucked up. I think I saw that in elementary school. Oh, my short life, I think it's one of the most moving movies in 19 years, but it's a little bit moving, and I haven't seen a sad movie since then.\ncaller: I don't think there's a movie I can't watch, I don' t see a movie I don' T see a movie, no, there' s no movie that I think I have to see, there is a movie that has some meaning, some kind of feeling, like I said before, a movie that doesn' t make you happy until you see it, it makes you happy and you don' t want to leave it, because you can' t judge it before you see the movie, until you choose the movie, or until you choose what you want to see, it seems like there is no such thing as a movie that you can't see until you' ve seen it, but when you see a few movies, you think it' s going to cost you money.\nreceiver: What if you have a girlfriend, but she's not your girlfriend, and then she shows you a movie, and then you have to buy it, and then the movie turns out she wants to see the movie, and that's the kind of movie you don't want to see?\ncaller: I don't like seeing romance with my girlfriends like that, and when I see romance, it's just a little bit weird, and I can't see the movie, and I've just kissed you, and we've just done this, and, yeah, that's why I think I won't see romance.\nreceiver: I mean, I sympathize with that, because my girlfriend and I broke up once, and then we met again, and we decided to go see a movie, and then she said, \"You can't take me back there and take me to see Nuar\", and in that situation, so I said, \"Let's see what she wants to see\".\ncaller: I've seen some really fun movies, like the one I mentioned earlier about Pacific Rim, not Pacific Rim, but it's kind of funny, and there's a little bit of content in it, and as I said, it's a bit of bad luck, and if you've seen a movie like this recently, without the sound in it, that's the movie, but this isn't a bad movie, but what kind of deal is it in terms of what kind of a deal is it, now there are two main characters, now there's two main charactors, now one of them can't speak, now he can't talk, and one of them is a little bit nice, and the other one is a good person, but now they're cleaning up the area and doing some cleaning work during the day, and now they have a separate business, and that business is dealing with corpses, and this is a gangster who comes out of the organization.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Is there another example?\nreceiver: I recently saw an example in the news where someone said that they had been asked for money at the recruitment stage in the form of tuition fees or paperwork fees, and this is definitely a scam.\ncaller: Oh, and you should be careful about asking for money, because in a real hiring process, you don't ask for money.\nreceiver: Of course, in the formal recruitment process, you never ask for money, but if you do, you should immediately suspect and report it to the police.\ncaller: But, Dad, what should I do if I get a call like that?\nreceiver: You need to respond calmly, and then naturally ask questions that further verify the person's identity and company information.\ncaller: For example, what would be a good question?\nreceiver: It's a good idea to ask the hiring manager's name, job title, and company location or contact information, because if you're a real hiring manager, you'll be able to answer.\ncaller: Yeah, I'll check with those questions, but what if he starts acting weird?\nreceiver: When that happens, you have to hang up the phone right away, find a way to verify it officially, and if possible, record those suspicious calls.\ncaller: A recording? Does that help?\nreceiver: Of course, because it can be used as evidence when you file a complaint with the police or other authorities.\ncaller: Oh, yeah. I'll try to make good use of the recording feature. Thank you so much, Dad.

I mean, I think that my parents came from the same hometown and went to the same school, and they were friends who knew each other. Of course, there's a difference in age, but the school is nearby and the house is nearby, so my parents and my parents and now my family around me, at that time, it's nice to be brothers and sisters with my parents, and friends who know each other, and so on.\ncaller: It's a bad word, but it's applied to your house, and it's probably a good word if you apply it to my house, because in our house, since I was a kid, my dad had to be a little bit paternalistic, or a little bit childish, but normally when you have children, you put the delicious pancakes in front of them first, but my dad always wanted to cook the ham in his father's mouth, which is more than half of the ham, and now we have two children, so why did he tell us this story? Because you are younger than me, you can eat the ham much more than me, that's why I'm still old, and I want to put it in, and if I don't want to put the pancakes, my mother will have to fight for the city, because I've always put the sausage in the pancake, and I've never been good at that kind of thing, but I didn't know that there's a fixed time of the month, so I'm going to have to build up a little bit more heat, but I really think it's time to\nreceiver: I don't know how it usually sounds, but I think of my family as strangers, because strangers are people who have different ears and personalities, different inclinations, and similar physical appearances, but they have different experiences, and they also have different thoughts and feelings based on their experiences, so I talk about strangers because that's why, even though I'm a blood relative and a brother, I can give advice about my thoughts and feelings, but I can't be manipulated, and I always have the idea that no matter what it is, whether it's a parent or a family, I have to be that kind of supporter, that kind of helper, that sort of thing that gives me wings, that helps me grow a little bit more, that sort-of nurturing position, and I think I have to say that, because this is the kind of framework that a family has, and that's the kind of frame that I want to live in, and if a mother speaks to me in that way, I'm not necessarily violent, and it's really bad for me, but it's not good for me, and of course it's\ncaller: When I heard you say that I'm an adult and you're my family, but I don't think you deserve to have that much influence and that much violence, I think you're right.

the movie theater.\nreceiver: Were there any babies that were noisy or uncomfortable?\ncaller: Uh, there were babies, and they weren't making that much noise, so it was fun.\nreceiver: Is there another movie that's impressive?\ncaller: You know, I've had a lot of fun, and I think I'd feel better if there was a little bit of Oates in the song.\nreceiver: It's not a famous movie, it's a Disney movie called Charmed Love, and it's an animated Disney movie with a human character who falls in love with a princess in the movie and a real man in the real world, and that's a musical movie, and it was a pretty big movie, and I was very impressed with the movie, especially because I loved the song.\ncaller: It's a fantasy, a fantasy romance, and that's what it feels like.\nreceiver: Yeah, that's what it feels like.\ncaller: If you want to see a movie at the fort.\nreceiver: I don't know what it's called these days, but it's Prison Escape, and there's a new movie coming out, and I'd like to see it.\ncaller: It's been so hot lately, I want to go see a horror movie when it comes out.\nreceiver: There's a movie called \"Renan\" these days, and it's a horror movie about nuns in a convent, so if you like scary stuff, check it out.\ncaller: I like your horror movies.\nreceiver: I hate it so much.\ncaller: I like it, and I've seen a few of them, and I like the horror stuff, but I also like the thriller stuff.\nreceiver: What's your favorite movie?\ncaller: I've seen it before, and it's called The Secret of the Angel Offense, and it was very counter-intuitive and really impressive.\nreceiver: He looks like a kid, but he's a grown man, right?\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I saw a video of you summarizing it on YouTube.\ncaller: Oh, well, it's not as much fun when you're spotted.\nreceiver: And I like thrillers more than horror, and in thrillers, cloak-and-dagger movies are a lot of fun.\ncaller: Yes, I did.\nreceiver: Especially the one in the closet with his body wrapped in rags.\ncaller: I think the movie was really nervous and fun at the beginning, but the back of it was kind of messed up.\nreceiver: Ever since then, I've been scared of motorcyclists with helmets.\ncaller: Well, then what other genre do you hate besides horror?\nreceiver: I don't think you like Marvel movies very much.\ncaller: I'm not a big fan of the Marvel series myself.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, there's something about men that I think they're gonna love.\ncaller: I've only seen one Marvel movie in the Marvel series, and it wasn't fun for me, but every time there's a Marvel movie, it's very popular.\nreceiver: He said it's fun to look at them in order.\ncaller: I've seen a few, but I don't think they're my type.\nreceiver: Harry Potter was fun, but it wasn't my style.\ncaller: It's just that there's so many episodes and I haven't seen them all from the beginning to the end, and at the end, I'm just looking in the middle, and I'm wondering if it's because there's no connection and it's not a little bit funny.\nreceiver: I mean, look at Netflix.\ncaller: Netflix was just a one-month free trial, but there's a self-produced movie on Netflix that I found really fun, and it was for the guys that I love, and it's really fun.\nreceiver: Isn't that the movie that came out that season?\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: I've seen that one before, and it's not funny.\ncaller: Neither was fun.\nreceiver: Your circle was a little colorful, and it wasn't fun, but I don't think it was fun to throw.\ncaller: What was so amazing about that movie was that it had a Korean woman in the lead.\nreceiver: But then...\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: You see, at the drama awards, it turns out she's Korean, but the real actress is Vietnamese.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: And did you ever see the movie \"Nao Yeo Mi\"?\ncaller: What's it about?\nreceiver: It's a movie that magically gives people, or banks, money in the bank to people.\ncaller: Oh, that's right. Leonardo DiCaprio was in it.\nreceiver: I don't know the name of the actor.\ncaller: Oh, I saw that.\nreceiver: Did you see the pitch?\ncaller: I've seen it before, but I can't really remember. I think I saw the whole thing.\nreceiver: I think it's in the top ten.\ncaller: So what's the best one?\nreceiver: I can't name all the best ones, but there's an American movie called Spa with that slightly chubby actress, and that's the funniest.\ncaller: I saw it in a commercial.\nreceiver: Oh, please.\ncaller: She's a black actress.\nreceiver: No, not another movie that was fun.\ncaller: I had a lot of fun watching Titanic, and even though it's over three hours long, I think it's very clear, very well-crafted, and it's based on a true story, and it was very moving.\nreceiver: I mean, Titanic was originally a big movie, but it was a little old, and I didn't think it was going to be funny, and then I saw Titanic, and it was so much fun that I wondered if it was really a movie that was made a long time ago.\ncaller: I've only seen a few episodes on TV, but I thought it would be fun.\nreceiver: And both actors and actresses are so beautiful and handsome, I think that's a big part of it.\ncaller: Leonardo DiCaprio is that guy, and I think most of the movies he's done were fun, but I can't remember the name of it now, and it's kind of like a time-lapse thing where the actress and the actor and the actor want to get along with the actress, the lead actress, and they want to go back in time and change it and change it, but in the end, let's stick to the present.\nreceiver: It's not a flip.\ncaller: It's not your flip. I can't remember your name.\nreceiver: And no horror or thriller, just have your favorite movie in the middle of the action.\ncaller: It's action, and I don't know if it's a genre or not, but action is something that I've never seen before, so I'm not really into action.\nreceiver: I mean, I didn't think I'd be into action, but it was fun, and it was fun.\ncaller: You saw something.\nreceiver: Uh, for example, I've enjoyed all the action from the royal family and famous actors.\ncaller: Like what?\nreceiver: Well, not lately, but from what I can remember, it's always fun to play the harmonica, and if the actors are funny, the actors will be famous, and I don't think I'll watch it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I've experienced this on a busy day in a busy house, but I've also experienced it in a lonely house, and when I was in a busy home, there was always a lot of work to be done at one time. The characteristic of a lonely home is that the body is comfortable, but there is no work, and there is no time to see the boss's eyes. That's the characteristic of the name 1. When you think you're busy and you're tired, but there's a lot to do, you see less of the boss, and you don't have any guests, but you see some of the bosses's eyes, and you know what's\ncaller: Yes, I think it's better for me to work in a busy shop, because if I'm not busy, the boss has nothing to do, and the boss and the other employees are watching me, so I can keep doing my job without being noticed, and that's why mentally, it's easier to work in the busy shop, but physically it's harder.\nreceiver: Yes, I worked in a factory, and I did it twice, once when I was working at Interpark, and I got a list, and I was doing housework for that book, Interpark, in a place where there were a lot of books, and it happened to be a large factory, and we had all those books in a cart, and we would go back and forth and do that kind of thing over and over again, and it was an alpha alpha that had lost a lot of weight, and I also worked at a chicken coop, and the chicken coop was a very simple job, and you would keep packing about 2,000 chickens, and in this kind of an alpha, you don't think a lot, you just keep moving your body in a regular pattern, and so it was a simple job, but I realized that it wasn't right for me.\ncaller: Yeah, I like the kind of work that you can do in a factory, where you can do simple labor, where you don't have to think about it too much. I've worked in a factory. It was a toothbrush factory, and it was divided into three parts: packing, cleaning, sorting, and I did all three.\nreceiver: Yes, I've heard of Cafe Alba, but I've never done it, and I've done a lot of odd jobs, such as serving in the halls, or doing simple labor in some factory, but I have never done Cafe Alba, and I would love to try Cafe Alba if I had the chance.\ncaller: No, I don't have any experience with Cafe Alba either, but I'd like to try Cafe Alba, which is kind of the highlight of my job, especially since Cafe Alba is mainly about making drinks, and I like to make something and I like it so much that someone deliciously eats the food that I make, so I would like to try Café Alba while I'm working, so I'm still looking for a job, and I'm looking for Café Alba in Wichita.\nreceiver: Yeah, I think there's a lot of good things about family restaurants, but there's also a lot of bad things about Alva, and the good thing is that because it's a big corporate corporate corporation, you can get your weekly allowance without being noticed, and because some of the work systems are systematic, that's a good thing, but when I was working at Peabody, I was a cook's assistant, and I was making pizzas and stuff like that, and there were a lot of people coming and going, and I think that kind of pressure to make a lot of pizzas in a very short amount of time was a burden on me.\ncaller: Yes, I had a very short three-day job at a restaurant called Hammy's Day just before this, and I was going to work steadily until December, but I had to quit after three days because the employee I was working with made me very angry and upset, and I made a lot of mistakes when I first started working, but I made many mistakes that year, and he said a lot of bad things about me personally, so I worked for three days, and I called my boss directly, and I told him that I couldn't afford to work in this environment, and I quit.\nreceiver: Yes, I did a short shift when I was working in the district, when I worked in Alba, it was very hot, and it was hard to come to work at lunchtime and clean and all that, but I only worked three hours a day and could only go out three times a week, so I only earned 3.4 million yuan a month.\ncaller: Yes, I know that Mr. Name2 is now working as an Al Arbaite at a restaurant called Youth Care, and I also interviewed for Youth Care before I went to work at Harlem's Alva, and the reason I decided not to work was because they didn't take care of their weekly allowance, and I know that there are many places that don't legally give you your weekly leave, and that's because you're working under the watchful eye of the workforce, but I don't want to work in a shop like this that doesn't give you your monthly leave, so I told the manager that I couldn't work in a store like this, so I thought I'd work in a big business or a franchise like that, because they don't pay attention to their weekly leave and they take care of it.\nreceiver: Yes, I don't think it's a good idea to have a job that doesn't give you a weekly allowance, and even at the youth center where I work now, where I work 30 hours a day for a week, the employees think that it's perfectly natural not to get paid, and that's why I'm not willing to ask my boss for weekly holidays.\ncaller: Yes, I've worked at a rest stop for a couple of days on a short-term shift, and then part of my shift was baking and selling pancakes and serving cooked chicken and colpop fries and stuff like that, and it was short, but it was simple, and it's a lot of fun because it's kind of simple work, and I've had a short work shift for two days or two days, but then I saw a promotional video, and I didn't see it myself, and I was selling pancake next to my apartment, and I said I bought four pancakes, so I guess I had a lot of interesting things to do on my day off, so if you know name2, have you ever worked in a rest stop?\nreceiver: No, I've never worked in a restaurant, but I've done a lot of work selling other foods, and I've worked at a place called a ketchup truck, where they sell a variety of different foods, like chicken noodles, and so on, and I wanted to eat there all the time, and I was very hungry.\ncaller: Yeah, I wanted to eat a lot when I was working at Peep's, and I wanted to work at a restaurant called Hammy's Breakfast, especially when I worked at a hammy's breakfast, because it was such a fancy breakfast, and my favorite meal is also a breakfast, and I was really sorry to see what guests left behind, and I just wanted to eat it, so I had some fries that the guests hadn't even touched.\nreceiver: Yes, I was working at a butcher's shop, and I was on a diet, so I was very hungry, I was serving the customers, and I wanted to eat meat so badly, that I would take the grill to the place where I was cleaning the grill, and I would eat the meat that was stuck to it, and then I would think to myself, I'm so sorry, have you ever felt as self-conscious as I did, eating the food that the guests left behind?\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."},

You don't use any of those things that are so easy to steal illegally, like a payday loan, or a negative balance, or a mortgage?\nreceiver: No, I won't.\ncaller: Yeah, so the overall purpose of use is all for revenue purposes, right?\nreceiver: There's only one bank.\ncaller: Now, Mr. Han Jae-ho, do you know the purpose of your deposits?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Can you give us an estimate of how much money you had in that account the last time you used the grant?\nreceiver: About 10 million won.\ncaller: So you're going to use all of this, including the entire financial system that you're using right now, and it's going to be under $10 million?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: What happens in the case of an entry fee?\nreceiver: Yeah, well, that's less than that.\ncaller: In the case of a savings account, how much more would you need?\nreceiver: That's about 20 grand.\ncaller: So you've used the entire financial system, including the one you're using right now, right?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: You don't use that part of the mortgage, the home equity line of credit, minus the overdraft.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Right? So if you have the rest of the money, except for the part that you've just stated, would you be okay with us freezing it?\nreceiver: Yeah, but once the freezing's done, is there any way to unfreeze it later?\ncaller: If you can prove that you're a victim without having to terminate it yourself, we'll process your bankruptcy and then you can use the securities that you were originally free to use.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So that's all you've said, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. If we investigate this part and find, for example, that there's a problem or that you haven't spoken about it yet, we'll send a letter of cooperation and a summons to the address in the manuscript.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.\nreceiver: I know.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

How are you?\ncaller: Hello, customers. This is Kim Min-soo, deputy head of security at Shinjuku Bank's headquarters.

I'm not sure what I'm talking about.\ncaller: Yes, sir, we have recently detected an illegal transfer of funds from your account to our newly established bank monitoring system, and we are urgently investigating and taking action in this regard. Have you received any suspicious transactions or contacts recently?\nreceiver: No, I don't remember any of it.\ncaller: If we detect any unusual transactions on your account, we will initially request an investigation by the FCA, and if the FCA investigates and reasonably suspects that you are involved in a crime, we will freeze your entire account.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And that's going to put you at a huge disadvantage in your financial transactions.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So before we send your transaction information to the Treasury, we're taking a few precautions to minimize the damage caused by the freezing of your account.\nreceiver: Yeah, what is it?\ncaller: In our past customer support experience, customers who have been harmed in these cases tend to no longer use the new bank even after they've been cleared of charges and their financial transactions have returned to normal.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We can't say that we're not responsible for mismanagement.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: That's part of what we recognize, and as a reward for that, we can provide you with a temporary account to circumvent the freeze.\nreceiver: How come it doesn't freeze?\ncaller: Yes, actually, it's a bit of a stretch, but we're going to create a new account in the name of our security management staff at Shinzo Bank, and we'll send the account number, password, check card, etc. to your customers.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You can then deposit your current account balance up to $50 million into your newly created account and use it, and then transfer it back to your account once the Treasury investigation is over.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This is because the accounts that you have in your account, the accounts that we manage in our company, are not sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, and you can use them without any problems because we guarantee credit.\nreceiver: Yes, I understand. Can you make it right away?\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, it's the Bank of China.

I'm counselor Kim Min-soo. Could you excuse me for a moment?\nreceiver: Oh, yeah. It's all right.\ncaller: Thank you! We're currently conducting a survey on life satisfaction in Seoul, and if you answer the survey, we'll give you a coffee voucher.\nreceiver: Yes, I'll take the survey.\ncaller: Thank you. Before we get started with this survey, I'd like to point out that the names, contacts, genders, addresses, etc. that we collect in the survey are personal data, and we need your consent to collect and use that data. Can you give us your consent?\nreceiver: Yes, I agree.\ncaller: Thank you. So I'm going to start the survey by asking you a simple personal question: What is your client's personality?\nreceiver: My name is Izzi.\ncaller: Yes, Mr. Izehyon, can you give me your contact information?\nreceiver: This is 010-1234-5678.\ncaller: Thank you. What about gender?\nreceiver: I'm a woman.\ncaller: Yes, Your Excellency, what is your current administrative district?\nreceiver: It's in the Gangnam District of Seoul.\ncaller: OK, so we're going to start with the actual survey, and the first question is, how would you rate your current level of life satisfaction, on a scale of one to five?\nreceiver: Well, I think it's about four points.\ncaller: OK, I'll give you four points. So what are the main reasons why you feel more satisfied with your life?\nreceiver: I think it's because they have a stable job and a good living environment.\ncaller: Yes, I'll list job security and a good living environment as the top reasons for satisfaction. The next question is, how would you rate the security situation in your current area of residence? Choose from a scale of one to five.\nreceiver: I think it's very safe.\ncaller: Yes, I'll give you five points. So what is your preferred mode of transportation?\nreceiver: They mostly take the subway and the bus.\ncaller: Yes, I'll write down that you use the subway and the bus mainly. How would you rate your satisfaction with transportation? Choose from 1 to 5 points.\nreceiver: Three points, because sometimes it gets crowded.\ncaller: OK, I'll give you three points. So do you have any suggestions or ideas for improving traffic congestion?\nreceiver: Yeah, I'd like to see more commute time.\ncaller: Yes, I'll note that you've proposed an increase in commute time.\nreceiver: Mostly watching movies or reading books.\ncaller: Yes, I'm going to write down that you spend your leisure time watching movies and reading, so how would you rate your satisfaction with the leisure facilities?\nreceiver: Four points. I'm mostly satisfied.\ncaller: Yes, I'll give it four points. Last question: Do you think there's something that needs to be improved in Seoul?\nreceiver: Yeah, I'd like to see more parks and green spaces.\ncaller: Yes, I'll write down that you want to expand the park and green space.

classify: <conversation>\ncaller: Who do you remember most from your high school friends?\nreceiver: I'm with name1 and you and name2 and not name3 and they're not that we went together after school every day but I'm not in the same direction these days and I have a house and I'm alone all the time so I'm lonely all the time and you guys remember uh you slept a lot in high school\ncaller: I mean, I slept a lot during math class, because I'm intuitive, so I didn't need math.\nreceiver: No, but I do, but these days I'm on the couch all the time, and I don't really wake up from 1:00 to 4:00, except for when I'm moving, and she's picking her nose a lot in front of me, so the kids are paying a lot of attention, and I want to wake her up, but I know she's really upset when someone wakes me up, and she sleeps a little bit, and she gets very sensitive when she wakes up, and I just don't know how to wake her.\ncaller: But picking your nose is a harmful behavior now, and I've seen many kids sleep when they're picking their noses, and some of them are studying hard, and some are sleeping, and it's okay if they're sleeping and not hurting, but it's hurting people, because it's exam time, and the teachers are going to wake them up, and you pick your nose in class, and you're hurting people anyway, so no matter how you do it, you don't have the right to make them feel bad.\nreceiver: Yeah, but she woke up today because some kid woke her up, and then she went back to sleep again, and now she's not sleeping at home, so she's picking her nose again, so the kids are really noticing, and the teacher just doesn't care, and she keeps going to class, because she has to make progress because of the coronavirus, and she's gonna be gone in two weeks, and then the exams are over, but then she's actually applauding, because she's lying on her nose and nostrils, and applauding when it's good, it's not like she's clawing her nose, she's scraping her nostrils.\ncaller: Why isn't he sleeping at home?\nreceiver: I don't know because I'm not friends with him, but he doesn't really eat lunch, he just keeps sleeping, but I've had too much sleep, and when I'm really, really bad at school, I never wake up from one to seven, except for moving classes, so what do I do?\ncaller: But it's also a little bit of a sleeping problem, but maybe the biggest problem is, you know, maybe he's not sleeping at night because he's got another job or something, or maybe he studies at night, but frankly, that's not the right pattern, the general pattern, and while that's a problem, and the fact that he's trying to sleep all the time, it's a little bit overwhelming, but it's one of the symptoms of depression, because sleeping is one of those symptoms of depression where you want to get out of there and away from reality, so if you get a chance, why don't you make friends with him and talk to him a lot?\nreceiver: But I don't always have a kid from the first to the seventh grade, and our third grade is not because of Corona, but this time it's not just this third grade, it's just that due to Corona, there's a break in March, April, and I've been out of school since the end of May, so third-graders don't have any friends in the class, and they're all friends with each other.\ncaller: But, you know, when you're in the third grade, they're studying a lot, and you're going to go to that business school, and they're gonna have jobs and they'll be studying, so it might be a little hard to get a little familiar in that kind of situation, but why don't you try to make a connection, like you said?\nreceiver: But she doesn't, and neither do I, and I don't have a lot of friends, so it's hard to make connections.\ncaller: Well, then, I don't think there's any sort of peer review or peer review at the moment, so it's going to be hard to get closer.\nreceiver: You know, it's like, almost, you know, practicing, you can pretty much tell me the answer, and that's the kind of objectivity, but some of them tell you the answer, so you can only figure out the other four, and it's just that the kids, they're almost at the 80th percentile, and I don't think he's studying at all, but I think that's not what I'm forcing him to do, because it's hard to get along with, so what should I do?\ncaller: Yeah, but you know, you don't have to wake up your friend and stop snoring, because if you're that uptight, you can't even be friends, and what's important to you right now is your career or your career, so you're choosing between your career and your career.\nreceiver: Yeah, I've decided I'm definitely going to college, but I'm the only one in my class who's going to go to college, and the kids who are getting ready for that job interview are a little loud, so I can't tell them to be quiet because I'm alone and there's a lot of them, but I can tell them that I'm actually sensitive because I am not, but I just feel sorry for them, and if I tell them to shut up again, it doesn't seem like that, so I've tried everything, and I'm either sleeping or studying, and I know what to do with them.\ncaller: Well, there's a way to keep them quiet, but, like you said, they don't do it because they want to gossip, and you have to prepare for an interview, so, you know, maybe you should go to the gym now and apologize to your teacher, or maybe you should buy noise-canceling headphones.\nreceiver: It's $300,000, but you used it.\ncaller: I've got the AirPod Pro two-by-two, which is noise cancelling, and I haven't used that, and I've used the Boss headset, which is a noise cancelling headset from a headset company, but it's definitely good, and it's kind of expensive, but I think if you get the chance, you should try it.\nreceiver: But I don't think you're going to get a lot of eye contact from your headphones, because you can put your headphones in your ears, but you can't wear your headphones.\ncaller: I bought a headset when I graduated from high school, and I didn't do much in college because of the coronavirus, so I've never worn a headset in class, but you know, I mean, you're teaching in class, and you're wearing a headset, and you don't have to spend time studying by yourself, but when you're giving tutorials, because now you can use your phone, you can wear a headset and get a little bit of attention, but you can't say anything, so I said, why don't you try it out?\nreceiver: Well, I'm a little worried that you're going to be upset because it's still class time, even if it's rehearsal time.\ncaller: Well, the other way is not that you can't study because it's a little too loud, so first of all, you've used the headphones, but you can use them again and get used to it, or maybe it's the best way to go to the classroom, but that's something that a lot of teachers don't allow you to do, and the class starts in 50 minutes, and you go back and forth, and you're only allowed to study for one, three, and 40 minutes, so it's kind of unreasonable, but I think there's a way to do that, because your school is a business school, but there are students like you who are going to college, and you have to support those students a little bit.\nreceiver: That's right, but this time, it's okay, but because of the corona, the job isn't coming because there's a lot of kids who want to go to college instead of work, and half of us aren't there, but that's what, uh, but can I go to college?\ncaller: There's a lot of different types of people in college, and going to college, you know, I've learned that there's a pattern, and then there's the curriculum model, and then the student model, and you can have another model, and I don't know the commercial model, because I went to the general journal, and I remember a friend from middle school called name4, and he came out as a big designer, and he said, \"Well, that's the design\", and he went to the dry cleaners, because he wanted to keep the characteristics of the journal, and so he said, well, if you're a little bit more familiar with it, there might be a pattern that's a little bit peculiar, so don't get too desperate, but why don't you try it again and call name4 and let them know?\nreceiver: Well, it's a shame that I'm not friends with him, but I'm more desperate because I don't have to go to that party, but hope is something you can always have, so, you know, you can give me some encouragement, too.\ncaller: It's desperate, because it doesn't end, because I've been preparing for my admission since the summer of my second year of high school, but that summer, from the summer of second year to the January of third year, I didn't write much, I read a lot of books, I saw a lot of movies, I tried hard to broaden my horizons, because I haven't seen much in my 18 years of life, I don't have a lot of experience, so maybe I'm desperate, but I had a teacher next to me, and I listened a lot to that teacher, and I think I got a lot of strength, because the thing I felt most when I was preparing for admission was that I had to have a great adult around me, because I was influenced by that adult a lot, so how about finding someone like that around you?\nreceiver: But I haven't decided on a career yet, so I'm just going to go to college with these grades, and I'm going to take the lowest grade in college.\ncaller: There were a lot of kids who were just good at studying, and a lot of them weren't good at writing, and they were just writing according to their grades, and I've heard a lot about university classes because of the coronavirus on the Internet, but what I've learned from listening to them is that you definitely have to do something that fits you a little bit, because it's a little different when you're taking classes related to literary creation and when you are just taking classes in parenting.\nreceiver: I guess that's true, but I've been studying lately, and I'm studying, and my friends are working, so it's a little bit out of the question, yeah, but I have to go to graduate school, and they're a little bit... they're not, they're just plain, and the kids are better than me every day at school, and the teacher is just giving me advice, so I think it's more relevant.\ncaller: Well, I used to be around a lot of kids who were just getting ready to go to college, but, uh, to be honest, I was also precocious, and we were semi-precocious, our school was not a precocious high school, it was a normal high school, and that's how it was, and now I feel a little bit like that when they were all precocious and reading and writing on their own, but I said that I was overdoing it, and overdoing that, and I have friends now that I've met, and I've worked really hard looking at those friends, and my friends' writing skills are the same as mine, and my ability to write short sentences is the same as their ability to write descriptive sentences, and at some point in time, I've realized that there's a little bit of a difference, and I felt like I had to work really hard, so I thought it would be good for you to find some friends like me around.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the

About five months ago, it was announced that Mr. Park was the founder of a new bank account opened by each resident, which is called the Kangdong City Withdrawal.\nreceiver: It's not.\ncaller: It's been used in crimes, so don't use it anymore.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: I'll take care of it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: All the money in it is now in safe deposit.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But now, the important thing is that when we arrived at the scene of the crime, Mr. Park's bank account had 38 million yuan and a bank account with seven hundred and forty million yuan in illegal funds.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: There were a lot of victims because of these funds, and this is the kind of thing that happened when the Kim Ho Chul party registered Park Min Chul as a seller online.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, Goga, Goga is selling airline tickets and merchandise tickets and stuff a little bit cheaper.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: I'll report it to the people who will contact me, and I'll give them the account number of Mr. Park Min Chul's account, and the number of his artillery depot account.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: He said he'd send you the goods if you sent him the money, and he intercepted it, and he didn't send the goods, and he's still in jail.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: In the case of the scam, Park Min Chul's name was used, and Park Min Chol's gunboxes were used, but as it turns out, there are property victims who transferred money to Park Min Chil's gun boxes.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I sent you money to buy some stuff, but the stuff didn't arrive, so you don't have to call me back, and that's when I admitted it was a fraud, and I've already filed a complaint for fraud.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: As of now, Park Min Chul is still registered as a seller, so he's facing a lawsuit.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I've been investigating this case, and I don't think that Mr. Park Min-Chil is involved in this case at all, and if this person turns out to be a victim, I'll help you in such a way that you can be acquitted if the victim is proven. I, um, I have information from the Financial Supervisory Authority and the statements and statements made by Mr. Parkmin-Chil from now on, we will not proceed with the consolidation of accounts for the account created by Mr. Pak Min-Chel. Where is the financial institution that Mr. Amine Park-Chil has directly opened an account and uses himself? Just tell us the name of the financial institution. So there is a new, new bank, a national bank, a postal savings bank, and there is something like this.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm going to start with the new bank, and the new bank deposit account is a personal account with a balance of less than what?\ncaller: Do you know this guy named Sun Tae Joon? He's Ne Ne Sun Tae Joon. Oh, let me explain this guy again. He was born in Guangzhou. He's from Guangzhou. Since high school, he's been active mainly in Seoul and the gaming community, and he worked for about a decade at a bank called the Bank of China for a forty-year-old man.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

A little while ago, they were visiting relatives who lived in the state with their families, and they were having dinner, and they had a house that was coming up the hill, but next to the illegal immigrants, there's a lot of immigration, and it's like this flood, these giant mountains, like rivers, so I don't know how the other refugees got up and down the hill by themselves, so I came home and I didn't have a sign, and now I've reported it to the police, and I've been told that they've found a body somewhere else, but there's no motive, it's dark, so I guess I'll just be dead, and then I can'\nreceiver: He has to change his position, he has to think about that position, and I don't think it's the right position for me to think about, oh, the refugees are really suffering, they don't have a home, they can't be taken in, they think the world is scary, and we live this happy life, and the refugees have no power, and the people who have power are powerless, the people who suffer don't really care, at least we think we should care, because we're human beings, and refugees have been causing problems in our country before, and we can't accept that, and at least we shouldn't worry, we're struggling and we're worried, and there's nothing we can do about it, and the answer to that has to be well-organized, and anyway, we have to take a lot of care and study how we can help them live as human beings.\ncaller: Well, it's like what the writer here or Professor Chris Lee said, but this professor is now a Korean-American, and he also said that if he goes to any country, he will be treated as a foreigner, but he said that we too are now seeing a lot of international marriages, and I think they will come in and have a lot of problems, but then they will come out again. They are foreigners. It seems that they can't adapt, and they commit many crimes, and they've been in and out of an international marriage, but then again, there are a lot of Koreans like you who are foreigners, and now you feel weird, and you don't join, and you get separated, and people from abroad are more likely to do it, especially from abroad. So I created a multicultural household language, so there are many programs for multicultural families, and multicultural homes for our children, and this time, the Western Cultural Center Choir is a large choir made up of multicultural houses, especially children's choirs, and so on and so forth. I think we can't adjust to being foreigners like any other\nreceiver: The problem is that when the refugee problem comes up, the problem is that they're still isolated, and it's just a mess, and they're in harmony, they're communicating, and it wouldn't be as bad as it is, because he's not prepared to deal with them, and they don't have anything to do to survive, so they're just making cases to survive, and that's not how it is, and any kind of support policy is important to protect them, but the multicultural cultural programs that you mentioned earlier, we think they're very good, we don't communicate with each other, we accept them as part of the community, and what's important is we accept them into the community.\ncaller: I've written novels because I'm attracted to people like refugees and immigrants, but the people who don't read those books probably aren't interested, and you know, if you don't have a specific article or something to say, you can't blame someone for writing it, because it's fiction anyway, but I think you should have some respect for writers who write about socially problematic things with this kind of interest and concern.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

First of all, it is the most urgent time for you to certify that you are involved in the case and that there is no evidence of collusion with Kim Soo-min.

Then let the case first arrive and explain the identity of the victim. First of all, since you are now saying that there is no evidence of illegal Kim Min-soo and conspiracy, I will register the case with the prosecutor in charge of the case, who is in charge of our prosecutor's office.\nreceiver: Yes, you can take notes.\ncaller: Yeah, well, write down the case number.\nreceiver: Hold on a second.\nreceiver: Please say yes.\ncaller: Case No. 2015 and the brother in the criminal justice system.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And 51-0668 is the kidnapping of Kim In-su.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: First of all, I'm going to put you on the line with the prosecutor in charge of this case, so please don't hang up.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: How are you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Hello, this is Inspector Ijun Seol, head of the financial crime team investigating the case.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Okay, first of all, you're a party, aren't you, Mr. Park?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're right. Tell me what you understand about the case.\nreceiver: I don't know exactly, but I'm sure you've opened an account on my behalf.\ncaller: I'll briefly tell you again about the incident: On January 7, 2015, we searched the Kim In-su Financial Institution, and at that time, we seized a bank statement from the Farmers' Cooperative and Shinhan Bank in the name of Mr. Park Ji-ho.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Now, at the time of these two orders, there were 87 million yuan in the Agricultural Cooperation Order, and 42 million yuan in Shinhan Bank Order.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Since this part was found at the scene of the crime, I had it frozen immediately, regardless of your doctor. In the case of illegal funds, it was transferred to the State Treasury. Firstly, if there is evidence that Mr. Park Ji-ho received money from Kim Min-soo, you are legally responsible.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This case is being investigated jointly by our public prosecutor's office and the Financial Supervisory Authority, and if you're a victim of a personal data breach, because you don't know exactly when and how your personal data was breached and from whom, until the case is closed, you can tell a third party about the facts of the case, or you could be subject to severe penalties in the event of confidentiality.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Let me briefly go back to a man named Kim Min-soo, who operated an illegal gambling site in the Philippines, if you know what I mean.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So far, we've seized two Farmers and Shinhan bank receipts in your name, and when I checked this Kim person on the spot, we seized 980 receipts, a total of 20 credit cards, and a total of 1,300 receipts including security cards written in paper and plastic security cards. Since the discovery of the 1,300 security cards is an area where your other bank accounts can be generated additionally, in this section, we're going to look at three to six months of transaction history from all sides of the Financial Supervisory Authority on the receipts you used.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you've looked at the transaction records, and if there's evidence that there's been an illegal transfer of funds from your account to Kim Min-soo, then you have to go through the legal process and appoint a personal attorney, and you have to appear in court, but if there is no evidence of an illegal transfer, we can also prove that you are an innocent victim, you know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Since you're claiming to be an innocent victim, in order to prove your innocence, you'll need to go to our Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office website and prove that you're an innocent victim in this case.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: To do so, go to the Neighbor or the next window and search for the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office website.\nreceiver: This is the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.\ncaller: The Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.\nreceiver: Yes, please click on the home page.\ncaller: I know.\nreceiver: If you click on it, you'll see in the upper left corner of the screen, \"Welcome to the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office\".\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: And if you look at the bottom right of the screen, there's a little sign there that says Privacy Infringement Reporting Center.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Please click on the Privacy Breach Report Center.\ncaller: Do you have a privacy portal, or an Internet Infringement Response Center?\nreceiver: Yes.

Where did you get the loan from?\ncaller: You've got loans from the Small Business Development Corporation, you've got scholarship loans and car loans, and if you take out a new loan, it's going to be less than the amount you took out on those three loans, so the rest of it is going to be loans -- it's got to be 30 million.\nreceiver: Yes, it's a non-recourse loan that's unrelated to the Small Business Development Fund, so you can borrow without any hassle.\ncaller: Well, that's good. What's the minus?\nreceiver: It's 3.4% a year.\ncaller: Yes, 3.4% interest rate on small business loans is so high that if you borrow all 30 million yuan, the interest rate is 1020 thousand yuan per year, 85 thousand yuan per month.\ncaller: I've never borrowed money at such a high interest rate, but I've heard it's 1 percent, and if the city subsidizes it at 2 percent, it's 1.4 percent.\nreceiver: Four years ago, it was 3.4 percent, but if the city gives you a subsidy, it's 1.4 percent.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: But the city's interest-bearing products have run out of money, so you'll have to see if they're also interest-bearers.\ncaller: Oh, no, where would you find out that if you're applying for a loan from the city's Department of Economic Affairs and the bank doesn't know about it?\nreceiver: There's been no guidance since the city's interest-only products ran out of funds.\ncaller: I've seen it on the city blog, and I'm going to contact the city's economic department and ask them to call the bank, but they haven't given me any instructions yet, so I might have to pay the full 3.4% interest.\nreceiver: Yes, it could be.\ncaller: No, the city says yes, the bank says no, and you have to dance on a stage because of the coronavirus, and it's freezing every day, and if the loan doesn't work out, you're screwed.\nreceiver: If you're uncomfortable, why don't you try a different loan, and if you're in the second tier, your personal credit comes out at 3.1%.\ncaller: If the city gives me an interest rate guarantee, I'll only get 1.4%, which is cheaper than a personal loan, and if I don't, I'm going to get a personal loan.\nreceiver: These loans are up to $40,000,000 if you have a second-tier credit rating.\ncaller: That's 10 million more than a small business loan.\nreceiver: Medium-term returns are as low as 0.5 percent.\ncaller: Well, I've already told you it's from the city, so we'll get some instructions, and then we'll wait a few days, and we'll contact you again, and if you say it's the city's interest-bearing loan, and if the city says it's not an interest-bearer loan, then I'll take the loan that you just told me about, and I don't think there's a lot of time to wait anyway, so I'll call you back next week.\nreceiver: Yes, I understand.

What's your last name?\nreceiver: It's the equinox.\ncaller: I just got a call, and if you have any questions, I'm the head of the finance department, Superintendent Choi Seok-hoon.\nreceiver: Who is it?\ncaller: This is Mr. Choi Seok-hoon, head of the finance department.\nreceiver: Yes, I did.\ncaller: Do you have any questions?\nreceiver: So we can leave tomorrow?\ncaller: You said, \"Wait a minute\". How much did you hear from your investigator?\nreceiver: I heard everything.\ncaller: You've heard it all, and you've heard all the parts about how you're going to get your money's worth now, so what do you do? We help you prove your victimhood with our own hands. You don't mind the time, but if you want to get out, we'll issue you a summons at the police station, and when the summons is issued, you'll need to have a number of pieces that match the time and date, whether it's a bank transaction certificate or an ID card, but you'll have to bring a large piece of paper with you.\nreceiver: I'm gonna go, but why is this the number?\ncaller: What number?\nreceiver: One six seven zero one eight thirty.\ncaller: That's our in-line number. There's one in-line team number, and there's one more in-line agent number.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: I'll call you first.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Enter your area code, and it's 1302.\nreceiver: One hundred and thirty-two.\ncaller: You'll find a search team there, and I'll call another one.\ncaller: 1566 2759 -- that's our first team's home number, and this one, and the one I called right away, is the desk number for the seven teams over there, if you can find it on the first floor, you can do that.\nreceiver: You want to come with me to Task Force One?\ncaller: Yes. First of all, we're going to give you a subpoena, and tomorrow you'll be able to take it with the meter, and you'll see that it's all written down, whether it's the date or the time, whether you're looking for your own reference, you can take that part of it, and you can put it out on the date, and it usually takes two or three days.\nIf you'd like to leave at that time, or if you have any questions, you can give me your home number or the number of your representative, and if you want to be identified as a member of Investigative Team One, your representative will take your call.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Have you finished your paperwork? Yes, I'll send you a summons, so please be on time and keep this visit to a minimum.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: I know.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Anyway, as a country, we tend to do a little bit of coercive action, and the government tends to listen to that.\ncaller: And if that doesn't work out, I'd like to see some sort of organization in the middle that's going to coordinate and create some sort of company or organization that's gonna coordinate and coordinate, and if that's not working out, I would like to have some sort of an organization that is going to be able to, as I've said before, have some kind of a law that protects the tenants a little bit, because the landlord is a landlord, so I think it would be a good idea to have that kind of legislation quickly, because there's a lot of competition these days, and there's lots of landlords, and there are lots of disputes between the tenants, and is there any way to save this economy and protect the rights of these tenants?\nreceiver: I'm not going to talk about how, but if you look at the news right now, it just says that he's been in Congress for two years, and there's a problem here, and I think that the tenant, of course, has set up the building for his own profit, and the tenant has a bad side, but legally it's not like this, and he has a tendency to force something and now he doesn't appeal to his bad side, and it's a legal state anyway, so you have to live by the law, so you should have met with the tenant in advance before this kind of thing happened, and you should have negotiated in advance.\ncaller: In France, for example, we have a nine-year legal protection period, and after that, the landlord has to pay the tenant's severance, and we have a long-term lease policy, and if there's a problem, the government will give you some of that subsidy, or whatever, so that you can go through it without fighting with each other.\nreceiver: Of course, there are things that can't be harmed legally, and there is a law that says you have to protect something, even if the public opinion is sympathetic, so what you don't protect is what you keep saying, but the law is that you have to first protect yourself, and when you see each other obeying the law, you have to defend each other, and if you do something wrong, you will be punished, and I think it's a little bit worse, but maybe you should have looked a little deeper.\ncaller: Now the parliament is fighting between the two opposition parties and this bill can not be passed quickly and in this situation the damage is obviously coming back to our people now, we want to quickly normalize and quickly pass the law in consultation with each other now and quickly recover the civilian life and become such a country where the people can live well, I think it will be better in the future, but Mr. and Mrs. Kim are very upset that they were forced out like this in the winter and somehow this happened, I think the landlord was a little too hasty, what do you think about that\nreceiver: The landlord has asserted his rights, and the court has enforced that ruling, and I've said it before, but you can't stop them from doing it legally, and I have said it again, but I think that if you negotiate with the tenant in advance before this kind of thing happens, I think it's going to be simple, I think we've just been living here in our minds, hoping to get more money out of each other, and I think that's the problem, and I should have solved it then, and anyway, I'm not a landlord or a tenant, but as my sister said, it's legally.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How are you?\ncaller: You know, customers, I've checked, and you've got what you said, and now we can make it a little bit easier, and you know, if you're a good customer, you know, yeah, I don't know what you know, but on our side there are people who have been doing a lot of trading lately, or maybe they've been using the long-term deposit account for a little bit longer, like, five years or ten years, and there's people like that, or there's other people who do a lot of deposit processing for us, and we're going out of the field through them, but you haven't made any deposits or deposits for us.\nreceiver: I don't think he did.\ncaller: Well, then, give me an example.\nreceiver: No, I don't think there is one.\ncaller: Okay, so we're going to take that into account, and we're just going to do a little bit of the deposit processing right now, and help you with the process, but it's hard for you to make a $30 million deposit right now.\nreceiver: Two or three.\ncaller: If you can, yes. Yes, yes.\nreceiver: So you're telling me you're gonna put the three grand in there?\ncaller: So it's a little bit difficult for us to process the deposits in the National Bank, but if you have subscribed to the bonus or something like that, it's very difficult to process the deposit.\nreceiver: If you're going to do that, then put in the money, and if you're not going to do it, put in the two or three.\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: You're talking about keeping it quiet for, like, a couple of years?\ncaller: I can't hear you.\nreceiver: So if you put this $3,000 in there,\ncaller: You got it.\nreceiver: You can find those three thousand right away, or you can keep them tied up for years.\ncaller: No, because you're an organ reservation officer, and you've been doing that for over three months now, you're going to have to make a deposit, but would you be okay with that part of the cost?\nreceiver: If I only have it for three months, can I hack it?\ncaller: Yes, sir, you can do that.\nreceiver: And then there's this phony drug fee or something, cancellation fee, termination fee?\ncaller: Don't do that, and if you do that after three months, you don't have to do that.\nreceiver: So how many reservations can I make?\ncaller: I mean, I've seen it happen, and it's going to take some work to get it right, but it's not that expensive, is it?\nreceiver: First of all, I'm going to borrow this and this and this, and this and that, and I'm still going to have a negative interest rate.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: If you get this, you don't have to replace the minus, right?\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: Well, I guess that's it.\ncaller: So you're using the minus sign right now.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: And if you do that, I think you're going to have to do it this way, and if you do it that way, it's going to take a little bit of time, and it's not going to be immediate, but it's at least a month, and then we'll have to watch and make sure that the scores go up.\nreceiver: So you'll get it in a month, and then you can get it in three months?\ncaller: After a month, we can give you approval if you're rated by us, and now you can cancel that deposit, which you can cancel after three months.\nreceiver: And then a month later, it's there, and it's a loan.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: The only thing I can break is three months.\ncaller: Yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you gonna be okay in terms of time?\nreceiver: But if I'm sure that I can get five thousand, then that's possible, because the three thousand is minus the loan, and it's inefficient to put this three thousand into the fund.\ncaller: Right, right. So in terms of time, this is a little bit difficult, in terms of cost, but it's possible in terms of both time and money, if this liquidity is blocked, that's the money that the client will feel appreciated and the price will go down a little bit, because the amount will not be seen any more, so we'll take that into account, and we'll create some self-help funds on that side, and based on that, we'll just do the pre-processing with the client, and we can do it quickly.\nreceiver: Can you repeat that?\ncaller: So, this is what we're doing now, and the disadvantage is that if you do it yourself, it's going to cost a lot of money, and it's also going to take a lot of time, and so we're going to have to get approval quickly, because we're a sales department anyway, and we're also going to be very efficient.\nreceiver: And if you put it in a joint account, what happens?\ncaller: We don't do it as a joint account, we just create the amount itself in the client's ledger, the record itself.\nreceiver: The record itself.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: And then from there, I'm going to be able to\ncaller: The burden is on the customer, and there's no such thing.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: I don't think I understand what the back office is doing, what it's doing to my brokerage account.\ncaller: It's sending money first.\nreceiver: I'm going to send the money I want to the minus account that I want to borrow.\ncaller: No, no, you know what?\nreceiver: And then what?\ncaller: So we're going to do this as a bank employee, and we'll send you the funds first, and this is going to send you the bonds first, and you'll send us the amount of the bond itself first, and that's going to be your bonds, and then we'll make it into your bonds in paper form, and just do the paperwork, and then you'll go into your customer's account, you'll do the pre-processing on your account, and you will make it into a deposit on your behalf, and now you're an existing customer, but you're a transactional customer, and if you're going through our bank employee so quickly, you don't have to wait that long for the deposit.\nreceiver: And then you're going to have that employee's money coming in here.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: It's going through my account.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: What about the money coming in?\ncaller: Yes, that's right.\nreceiver: How much?\ncaller: Uh, I'm guessing somewhere between two and thirty million, sir.\nreceiver: Two or three thousand dollars, that's good.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: So what happens when it comes in?\ncaller: And we're going to transfer that to the client, and we'll process it on behalf of the client, then we'll re-process it, and then it'll be transferred to your client, and then you'll be eligible, and then we will approve it on that basis.\nreceiver: And then what happens when you get the approval?\ncaller: No, that's the money that's going out, sir. It's just been pre-arranged, it's been deposited first, and it's coming out, and, uh, now that it's approved, we're going to send it to you with an issuance order, and you can take it and issue it again, sir. And it's going to take about four days, or two days, if it's short.\nreceiver: Let me see if I've got this right.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: I'm an employee, and I come in through my account there, and it's not the money that's coming in, it's something else.\ncaller: Yes, you are.\nreceiver: The entry and exit records, the bonds, whatever you bought, the listings.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: Two or three thousand records.\ncaller: Yes, that's right.\nreceiver: So it's not really money coming in.\ncaller: It's actually money.\nreceiver: Oh, the money's coming in, and you're taking it from that side?\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: Oh, so I'm going to keep a record of the money coming in and going out, and that's where I put the money in and took it out.\ncaller: That's right, sir.\nreceiver: Oh, well, that doesn't seem to matter, does it?\ncaller: It's expensive and time-consuming for you to do it yourself, but if it's done by one of our bank employees, you don't have to be so rude.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: That would be...\nreceiver: Okay, now I get it.\ncaller: Yes, yes, yes, and the reason we're doing this is, to be honest with you, we're in sales, you know, marketing, and we have to get approval fast and fast, and if I'm going to do a window job, it's going to be a slow process, but we're dealing with a very different kind of work than a window job.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: First of all, the fact that I'm sending the money first, and you're the client, you have to think about it, is I'm just going to trust you and let you go?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm going to be responsible if you use it, or if it's misplaced, or it's automatically transferred out of your account.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Oh, right. So the stock market banks only use the national banks?\nreceiver: Uh... no, with the Strait.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: Consolidation and the People\ncaller: You only use two?\nreceiver: There's a trust that manages other things, other money coming in and going out.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: There's companies, and there's different money, different uses.\ncaller: It's a use.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're new, you're an entrepreneur, but you don't use it much?\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: Because your customers are your customers' personal accounts anyway.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, the more accounts you have, the faster it goes.\nreceiver: I have a check from a credit card company, a bank, a national cheque.\ncaller: Do you have any?\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: Do you have a check card for each of the four places I just mentioned?\nreceiver: The company definitely has a check card.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: I think people have cheque cards, but they don't use them.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: There are no limits.\ncaller: There is no God.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now that I understand the situation, do I need to explain anything else?\nreceiver: No, no, no. I got it.\ncaller: Yes, and you're going to have a choice, and if you're a good customer, and I'm going to build on that performance, you'll be able to increase it, but you're not going to increase it.\nreceiver: Oh, because I want 50 million.\ncaller: You want some?\nreceiver: Oh, I said I'd take the whole thing, but I'd give you three grand.\ncaller: Oh, please.\nreceiver: I want the extract.\ncaller: Oh, that's more like it.\nreceiver: We're going to fill this place with grass instead of other places, and then we'll fill other places with higher interest rates, and we'll take a little bit less of the negative.\ncaller: Well, then you're asking for a raise because you've barely gotten word from the proxy.\nreceiver: I can't get to 5,000 at the most.\ncaller: He didn't say that to me. Yes, he did.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: And then you can have an extension, so do what you're doing, but frankly, I have to have a lot of faith in the client.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: If you're going to get into the proceeds of that deal, this budget deficit, it's going to be about $40 million or more for our employees, and that's a lot of money.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yeah, but honestly, I'm doing this on my own authority, and I can't do this to anyone.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.\ncaller: Yes, that's why I'm doing this, because I believe in it, and I'm going to do it, and then you're going to have to do some preparation when you do it, so that you don't lose all your money.\nreceiver: And then the people.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: We need to concentrate.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: As a company?\ncaller: Do you have a credit card? Do you not use it well?\nreceiver: No, it's what's in there. It's for a separate use.\ncaller: Unless that's the case, please proceed, sir.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: I'm going to text you the contact number of the representative of the cooperative, the national and corporate bank, the contact center, the customer support center, so would you please call them and find out how much you can transfer from the ATM machine to the ATM machine with that check card for a day, and then call me back?\nreceiver: Yeah, I know that.\ncaller: So we can figure out what your withdrawal limit is and what your withdrawals limit is, and then we can work out where the money's going to go or something like that, and we can calculate how long it'll take you to get there.\nreceiver: What's the going rate on this?\ncaller: Yes, yes, yes, of course.\nreceiver: I -- wait a minute -- I get it, but there's one more question.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: The bond money, I said the bond money comes in and goes out like this, and I have to tell them what card number or password or something like that, and they have to be free to come and go?\ncaller: No. To do that, the client -- I mean, the client doesn't necessarily have to visit.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: You know, this is something that you're going to have to do with your client and with us, whether you're coming to our office or you're doing it this way.\nreceiver: So this is what I'm supposed to do, find the money, put it in, find it and put it in?\ncaller: It's not about that, it's about you and your customers and us doing it together.\nreceiver: Oh, please.\ncaller: Because that's where the money moves, it's done in our interview room, and we don't normally ask you for the passcode or anything like that.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: I'm sure you know that.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: But it doesn't help that when I tell you about a case, and it's a little bit difficult to visit, or you've done that, but now I'm in charge, and if you give me the password and the password, you never ask me for the OTP or any of your customer's important information, you just ask for the password and take the check card, and I'll take it from your customer, and if it's really annoying, and you only do it when it's possible to visit, it now takes two or three days to schedule a visit with your client, and we'll do it in one or two or three hours a day.\nreceiver: All you can do is meet like that.\ncaller: Uh, when would you be available, sir?\nreceiver: In the morning...\ncaller: In the morning?\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: Do you have access to our offices across the street?\nreceiver: Yeah, well, what time can we go over there?\ncaller: I'll check my schedule, and then I'll call you back.\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Do you have any information about the opening of these accounts?\nreceiver: There's a strait, but I don't think there's one.\ncaller: Are you at work right now? First of all, we've given you a couple of check-ins to see why you've handed over the notice to someone else, whether you're being paid for it or whether you've been the victim of a data breach, and we've made a check-in call, because the process itself is being recorded, and if you're at work, would you mind sitting in the break room with your ball and pen for a moment and talking?\nreceiver: Talk to me.\ncaller: No, I hear a lot of noise from the side, so I'll just take a note. First of all, this is the Seoul Central Police Department. I'm a high-level criminal investigator. Firstly, I said that these two accounts are only used by the Agrosho Bank now, because Kim Hocheili is the main perpetrator of this case and has been overpaid in Agrosho for a long time.\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: First of all, we're not the only ones involved in this case, there are about 200 people across the country, and our prosecutor's office is conducting a preliminary investigation to sort out who's suspected and who's not, and once we've checked and contacted, but in the case of Mr. Imi, it's the call log or the location of the message, when we've traced it, there's no indication of anything other than these two accounts being found, so we've contacted them wirelessly, you know?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: First of all, on February 11th of this year, do you happen to know where the game's light is?\nreceiver: No, I know, but I've never been.\ncaller: We've checked that the account was opened on February 11th at the Iron Mountain branch in Phnom Penh. If it's a Wednesday, and you're an employee, you were at work today.\nreceiver: Well, if you want to talk about it later, I can send it to you.\ncaller: First of all, because we're the illegals who were found at the scene of the crime, we had them frozen when we found them. Do you have any idea what that means?\nreceiver: What exactly do you mean?\ncaller: The most important thing is that when these two accounts were found, there were 38 million RON in the CIS and 7.9 million RON of illicit funds in one bank. Once we had confiscated these funds in the country and there were victims who said they had these funds. Once you gave them to us because you were exposed to them, or because you are the agent of your name, because you have filed a complaint with the company, we contacted you immediately.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You're young, so I don't think we're going to issue an eviction order, but you'll have to cooperate a little bit on the phone, because you've just stated that you don't know anything about these two accounts, and that's true. First of all, as I said before, first of all, there's a lot of noise in the neighborhood, and then this doesn't have any effect on the evidence, and the judge is going to hear it personally, and second of all, other than these two accounts and the financial securities that you've opened and visited the bank yourself, what financial securities do you use?\nreceiver: There's only the Strait.\ncaller: If you're a victim, we're going to ask the Treasury for some information about the securities that you're using right now. First of all, we've just found this in the Gulf of Aden, and the bank that was found is now listed as a corporation. So this is a private person? Except for the Yogur account, when we asked for this information, there's no reason to freeze any additional accounts. Do you use an account in the Gulf? You don't use anything else?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you have any mortgages or savings accounts?\nreceiver: I'm not doing it.\ncaller: You have to be sure about the rest of the accounts. We've compared this, and if you have another account, you've opened two accounts that you didn't know about before, and we're going to treat that as the same account, and then we'll have it frozen. When was the last time you traded, like in the case of the Gaza Strip?\nreceiver: We're still in business.\ncaller: So the last time you made a transaction, it's confirmed that if you used a check card, you used it today or you used it at some point.\nreceiver: I used it yesterday.\ncaller: Yesterday? Well, first of all, you used it yesterday, and do you remember where you opened it?\nreceiver: When you were in the army, when you were a soldier.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

These days, it's not just Christmas cakes, but the cakes themselves.\ncaller: There are a lot of people who make their own cakes to order, and they make more cakes with fancy designs, and I think that's opened up another field for people in the design profession, not because they don't have a job, but because designers who have a lot of work, who don't really have much choice about what they do, have another choice, so I think it's a great opportunity for designers, and consumers, to make the kind of cake that they want, because it's the only cake in the world that doesn't have an order, and so I thought that the happiness and satisfaction that comes from that is special, and I thought it was a win-win situation for both of us, because design cakes are so much more expensive than ordinary cakes.\nreceiver: And I think that's why the price goes up, because there's so many people looking for the cake, and they tend to use that to push the price up a little bit, but then again, if you think about it, these are often custom-made cakes, and they're so visually stunning, like you said, that the designers who make them think that they're not worth the price, and I don't think it's a big disadvantage because there are so many people who are satisfied and happy to receive the cake, as you said, because things like cake design are so popular these days, and there's a lot of people who make their own DIY cakes and go to those classes.\ncaller: In fact, I used to think it was too expensive for the price of making a DIY cake, but these days the price has gone up for character cakes that are designed as a whole or custom-made cakes, so compared to that, a DIY cake seems to be relatively inexpensive, so more people are looking for it, and they can make it themselves, so it's more meaningful, and I think it's another good option for making DIY cakes, like a character cake, because there's a so-called character value over a normal cake, and given that, is there any advantage to having a character cake that's worth buying?\nreceiver: I think there's enough of that, because it's especially popular with grown-up kids now, and then there's the characters, and the parents who buy it have the parents that buy it, because there's a huge demand for it, and I've heard that when you buy something like this cake, there's an extra charge, and that's why there's more demand for it.\ncaller: Modern art literally reflects the present, reflects the modern age, and it's a field that clearly expresses some abstract thing that is expressed in art, so I think it's probably a natural progression that the most interesting and popular things right now, character cakes and custom cakes, are expanding into contemporary art, because there are more trends like weaving or cattle ranching, and there's a lot of people in their 20s and 30s who think that money buys happiness, and that's okay.\nreceiver: I guess I'm from that generation, so I have a lot of empathy for it, and sometimes I'm like, \"Oh, my God, I'm just going to pay a little bit more for my satisfaction or just my happiness, and I'm going to be pissed off\", but even if I am, I think I'm satisfied with that, so it's not worth the money, but in a way, it's calling the younger generation overpriced, and it's causing prices to go up too much in certain areas or things like that, and I don't think that's a bad thing, because I've been thinking about that and I've become a little more focused on my own happiness, and that's why I've spent a little bit too much money looking for happiness and spending a little less money worrying about it, but I think it's okay with this trend.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

We have completed the income tax return and the closing tax return, but we have not yet received any income because we have been operating for less than one year. Next year, January/January, we can file income tax returns for this year's operation, but according to the income tax certificate, it is almost impossible for the bank to refund income.\ncaller: But first of all, let's look for it, and what we found is a full-tax payday loan, this is not income, but it looks like it's going to be the minimum amount for unemployed people (3000) / (three thousand) so we check this and that on the website, enter the information and search, theoretically it says (27700000 yuan) / (two thousand seven hundred and seventy million yuan).\ncaller: But with the money I have and the additional loan (3000) / ((three thousand)) I think it's going to be hard to get as far as I want, so I'm willing to borrow some more.\ncaller: I'm not sure yet, but I'd like to go to at least five thousand, five thousand, ten million, one billion.\ncaller: And if you go to the bank and talk to them, you have to come to their house and put in an address and do a search, and then you have to know roughly how much money they're going to lend you, and it's not easy to look for a home based on that amount, but you want to know how much you can borrow.\nreceiver: It's true what they say, the credit limit is determined by the credit rating.\ncaller: Oh, is that so?\nreceiver: So you can see if you have to come up with a loan limit.\ncaller: Is it possible to borrow more than 3000?\nreceiver: If you're comfortable with credit, you can go over 3,000.\ncaller: Yeah, so we'd like to make loans only to banks that are financial institutions or accredited institutions, and we want to avoid these kinds of large-cap bonds, is that possible?\nreceiver: It's possible in the financial world.\ncaller: If it's okay with you, what's the limit? What's the interest?\nreceiver: The interest rate ranges from 2% to 3% to 3%, from 80% to 90% to 50%, up to 400 million yuan.\ncaller: I can prove my income, and I'm paying a lot of health insurance, but what do I have to prove my income to get a loan?\ncaller: Well, it depends on the limit, so if you submit both the business and the health plan, and you check your financials, can you verify the limit plus verify that there's an expected expense, but you're almost done paying it?\ncaller: Yes, my name is on the business license, and I'm a business owner now.\ncaller: And then I'm going to prepare the paperwork, like the business registration form, the application form, and the Global Compact Agreement, and I'll apply.\ncaller: Can we get the results back on the same day?\ncaller: You're welcome to do the autopsy with me.\ncaller: Do you think it's possible for a husband and wife to share the same name?\ncaller: It's a copy, is it?\ncaller: So the loan and the mortgage have to be identical, but can they be co-signed?\ncaller: Yes, thank you, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can from home.\nreceiver: Yes, thank you.

If you've been saving, you've probably spent most of your life saving for birthdays, and children's birthdays are the biggest, and we eat good food, and in fact, it's very meaningful for families to get together, whether it's a small or a large family gathering, or a birthday gathering, because there are so many spaces where families can come together, and it's not as easy as it seems, but it's hard.\ncaller: I feel like you're the best thing that's ever happened to me, that you've given me the greatest gift, and I feel a little bit like this, like this really big supporting structure, like I can't exist without it, and sometimes I think about it, and I think, oh, I wish you had lived longer than me, and somehow I feel like I'm not going to be able to cope, and I'm thinking a lot about how much I'm looking forward to it, and actually, I think more about you than I think about my boyfriend or whatever, and I expect more from you than I do from my parents.\nreceiver: You have to have expectations for your children, rather than expecting something big, you just have those little expectations while you're raising them.

Do you know a 42-year-old man named Kim Sung Chul, who lived in the city of Seongnam?\nreceiver: No, I don't know.\ncaller: I don't know, have you lost or stolen anything in the last two years that could leak your identity, like a cell phone?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you have any information about the opening of the People's and Co-operative Bank on January 26, 2015?\nreceiver: I don't have a yes.\ncaller: We've been contacted by our investigative team, who recently discovered a financial fraud ring belonging to Kim Yoon-chul. Importantly, we found a large number of cash registers and credit cards at the scene of the searches, among which we have now found a receipt from the People's Bank of China and the Agricultural Cooperation Organization, identified as belonging to Mr. Oh Seung-min. Do you know anything about the opening of these two accounts?\nreceiver: Not at all.\ncaller: First of all, it seems that from our point of view, we have contacted Kim Jun Chul with a certain amount of compensation and focused on whether you are the perpetrator who handed over the account or sold it or the victim who was named. If you say that you do not know at all, you can now prove that you are an innocent victim.\nreceiver: It's work.\ncaller: I'm your boss, so can we just get on with it?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you're lying or have something to hide, you'll be charged with trespassing and obstruction of justice.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You don't know Kim Seung Chul, who lived in the city of Seongnam?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: Is there any truth to the opening of the People's and Agricultural Cooperation Bank's branch in Buyangdong on January 26, 2015?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: In the last two years, have you lost or stolen anything that could leak your identity, like a cell phone?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: Even if you say that there is no evidence that you have opened this account, now we have frozen your account because it has already been misused, regardless of your doctor. What is frozen is that we have stopped you from using it. Apparently, now the transaction has been made with an illegal account and there are about 200 to 250 victims on that side, so we have contacted the internal line at 2 o'clock on our side. We have called the internal line for convenience because we have been in the internal room all day and now you can't appear. I will ask you a few more questions, but now we will ask a simple question about the banking license of the bank. In any case, if you have doubts about the internal account, I will tell you why and I will explain why.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, as I mentioned earlier, your statement has to match the SEC's access records in some way so that we can help you as a victim, and there's a chance that other bank notes or illegal accounts besides what you've stated will be frozen.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We're a law enforcement agency, and we're not even allowed to ask you for your personal information, or your account number, account number, or password, so you don't have to worry about that.\nreceiver: Hey, I'm in the middle of something.

So, by January 2016, the regime was over there, right now, when the government party is in power. By January 2016, so not before that, so just a few months before the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, but look at the moment, when Park came to power, that is, after the current government came into power, it's not a sin to have a mortgage on a building, property taxes and so on, but the provincial government has raised the mortgage by more than 15 times since then, so I heard that since that time, the government has raised its public debt by more than 100 million dollars, and the local government has changed its tax regime by 150 million dollars, so I think it's a bad thing for the people who don't have a lot of properties in this government building, because the government has a right to guarantee their ownership of this building.

It's the church in front of the Black Lion Elementary School where my mother-in-law lives. The building had a waterproof fence on it. There was a dining room on the ground floor, and there was this awful nest, and there were some things like that.

In the course of seizing a large number of cash registers and cheque cards, we found the account of a cooperative and corporate bank named Mr. Izi Hoon. So we're actually contacting him right now. And now we've found out through an official request to this bank that about 70 million yuan of illicit funds have already escaped from the Philippine side of Manila, and the remaining few tens of millions are now being processed in the same way. Do you know anything about these two accounts?\nreceiver: Now, neither of those companies have ever been built, because the Constellation hasn't been used for a long time.\ncaller: Because this directory was opened on December 17th, 1414 at the Dongshan branch in Yingliang district in his own name over the course of two days.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: The reason I'm contacting you today is to find out if these two accounts are accounts that you opened yourself and sold to the Kim Jong-su Party, or if you are the third victim whose personal information was stolen.\nreceiver: I'm sorry, where did you say it was?\ncaller: I'm a financial crimes investigator with the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: So now you're doing an online subpoena investigation, and because it's hard to tell if you're the victim or the perpetrator of this incident, most of us think you're a victim, and we'll call you, but once we have people reporting it, the people who sent the money to this courier are going to have to...\nreceiver: Why are you sending money?\ncaller: Kim Jong-su's party has been informed of the fact that they have been asked to send money for the purchase of goods on this part of the old country site, but now they have shut it down. This is the crime of the big gun crime, which is not sending goods, but only receiving money. Most of the victims are not only you, but there are about 200 of them now, and we are investigating them by calling them every day, but some of them have received money and sold the money.\nreceiver: You did?\ncaller: So, by any chance, have you ever traded or sold a coin?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Now, if you're the one whose personal information has been leaked and a memo has been created, you could literally suffer some secondary or even tertiary financial damage, because these people are people that Kim Jong-su is from the former Soviet Union, and most of them are people who worked in card companies or this kind of financial business, and there's four or five of them who haven't been published yet and don't know which financial sector they're currently covered in, so we're still investigating. First of all, you can't do anything, but if you say through the investigation that you have a connection with the Workers' Party of North Korea, you're going to get an online phone call, and the investigation stops, and you'll have to submit to a slightly higher compulsory subpoena, but at least you won't be responsible for this disgraceful incident if you are an unrelated victim, and then we'll also send you a victim identification card, and if you have it, you can go to the local social services, and there you can get some compensation for the loss of personal information.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And I'm going to ask you a few questions to help you figure out if you're a victim or a perpetrator, and since the whole process is recorded, I'd like to ask you to say what you're saying, and not make false statements or false statements.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Let me give you this case number: 2014 investigation 2005 This is the case number of Kim Yong-soo financial fraud. So from now on, as we proceed with the recording, I will ask you a question in a question-and-answer format. I am a financial crime investigator and Park Chil-ho investigator of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. What is the identity of the party?\nreceiver: My name is Kim Dong Hyun.\ncaller: Where do you get your calls now? At work? At home?\nreceiver: It's work.\ncaller: Once you're recording critical pieces of evidence for a victim's testimony, if you hear the voice of a third party, not me, it may or may not be difficult to get the evidence to be used later in a trial, so use it in a quiet place.\nreceiver: I'm the teacher.\ncaller: Are you a schoolteacher?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. So let me ask you another question: Is it true that Mr. Kim Yong-soo, a 43-year-old man, opened a corporate bank account on December 14th, at the Yonsei Pagoda mining site?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Are you aware that this device was used in the kidnapping of Kim Jong-su?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Now, I've said before that this is a freeze-dried account, whether it's an account you opened and sold, or you're a victim of identity theft, and I'll say it again on record that we're conducting an online call investigation under Section 42, Section 9 of the Summons Investigation Act. Do you use Internet banking or telebanking when you transact?\nreceiver: They use telebanking.\ncaller: Yeah, well, why don't you text your phone when you make a deposit or withdrawal?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I understand, but have there been any recent deposits or withdrawals from any of your accounts that you didn't know about?\nreceiver: Now, I don't think it's ever been done before, but I only have two accounts that I'm using right now, and the other banks don't even check.\ncaller: You're not doing anything?\nreceiver: They're not using the search itself, they're barely using it.\ncaller: You're saying that you're also using a human cannon.\nreceiver: Yeah, I haven't used it in a while.\ncaller: I don't know what's going to happen with that.\nreceiver: There isn't.\ncaller: First of all, this is a special grand jury murder case, so the most urgent procedure right now is for you to clarify through this account tracing investigation that you are an innocent defendant with no evidence of collusion with these criminals.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: First of all, the purpose of this account tracking is to see what kind of money flowed in to increase wealth, and then to trace the routes of illicit money transfers.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Once you've been investigated, and you're operating a legitimate fund, you're going to be an innocent victim, and our prosecutor's office is going to write a claim on all of these financial fraud cases, on all of the banks that your victims are going to use, if you know what I mean.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Did you happen to mention which bank you've been using for the last six months?\nreceiver: Do I need to mention that?\ncaller: It's just the name of the bank.\nreceiver: The Bank of Korea and the National Bank.\ncaller: This is one account or two accounts?\nreceiver: There are two Daewoo banks and one National Bank.\ncaller: If you make a final transaction, and I'm going to do it a few days ago, a couple of days ago, what's the normal amount? A million dollars, a million and a half.\nreceiver: It's less than a million. There's very little, if any, salary coming in.\ncaller: He's got two big bank accounts.\nreceiver: One of the big banks is in the red, so there's no money.\ncaller: You're saying that one big bank is minus one big bank, and the salary comes in?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Have you filled all of the minus columns?\nreceiver: I don't know.\ncaller: And once we've done that, we'll send you an insurance claim, and if you look at the document that we've sent you, there's a summary of the case, the current phone number, the number of the prosecutor's office, and everything, so when we send it to you now, you can just take it and call me back, if you have any questions, give me a call, and then we will send you a claim for damages, in case, if you've seen the damage, but if you haven't seen the damage you can't fill it out, you know what I mean?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you haven't been harmed, you don't have to fill out this claim form, because some of you are not harmed, and some of you come in and apply, and we'll compensate you separately, and for the part where you've been victimized, we'll do it separately, for the part you've personally been harmed.\nreceiver: Can I have your phone number over here?\ncaller: No, it's an in-person call, and the paperwork is on the form, along with my directory number and ID.\nreceiver: So I'm not making the call, you're making the call?\ncaller: Yes, you can call us again, and if we decide that there's no damage in the first place, we will not call you if we can, and if you have any more documents, if you have questions, if you're confused, if this happens, you can give us a call.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

classify: <conversation>\ncaller: There was a story that came out recently about the murder of the landlord's tenant by the owner of the barber house, and I was surprised when I saw the news, and I first thought about how desperate the landlords can be to kill people, so I guess what I feel is that what's wrong with our country is that when I see the relationship between the landlorde and the tenant who works in the building and the tenants who work in the building, the system itself always returns to the tenant of the building, and this is the case that represents it, and I read the article, and I felt that something is wrong with all of us, why do we go back to the tenants because I'm surprised that after five years, the building owners can pay their rent as they please, and then when people started to rent, it's usually five years later, so we have to take the place less than three years, and then we take the place more than three years later, and then the money is taken away from the tenant, so if the tenants start to move here, they think it's a good time to raise the building.\nreceiver: Well, I didn't know much about this case because I don't have a carpenter or any close relatives who do business, and I honestly didn't really know much about it, and I wasn't aware of these specific legal issues or anything like that, but I found this article and I found out new things, and I felt again that there was this big problem, and that the law didn't work in the case of a tenant who didn't have this, and I really felt again that it was really hard for a person to settle down and live well if they didn't want to, and I had to feel very strongly that if you suddenly put this kind of collateral or rent on top of everything, how hard it would be to be a tenant and you wouldn't be able to do business if you didn't get help from the law, and I thought that it was five years, and that everyone could really sit down and take care of a person and earn a little money, but I thought it was a five-year period, and now I'm sitting down and I'm going to earn some money, and maybe after five years I'd like to have\ncaller: I mean, I've been watching the news and what I've thought the furthest away is why it's five years when we generally look at people who have tenants' buildings and people who have assets that are almost as good as the ones we know, celebrities or whatever, but we're talking about politicians and these people are almost as well-known in Seoul and they have buildings that cost a lot of money, and then you have to think that a system that goes back and forth is not going to be an asset protection system, and so what we've seen in the news is that in developed countries like seven years or something, almost every taxpayer has to go back and forth to asset protection, and we've all experienced that, but everything that we have has to be asset protection, because people have everything, and they're in politics and they've got it, so we can't change our minds about the system itself, so there's no reason why I should think about it, or why we should take away their assets, or why they should kill their owners.\nreceiver: I don't remember this article because it didn't get a lot of attention, but it seems like it's a big deal, and if I didn't know it, I'd like to think that it's just vague and there's some parts that aren't big, and I think it's an artificial legal legal problem, and then the people who make the law don't have the luxury and don't know how to represent the feelings of these rental car owners, so this law isn't set up like this, but it's the first thing to do is make a legal amendment, and that's too hard, it seems a little bit, how do we solve this, once people who have the power to do that, second and third, we don't want to continue similar types of incidents, while we're in this very narrow piece of land, the poor cars are getting bigger and bigger, and we don 't feel this is serious, and I hear the idea that this is really breaking down because there are a lot of people who are making these legal improvements, but equally, it's going to be a little bit of a\ncaller: I don't think we're going to see that kind of society, and I'm a little bit negative, but I think in places like the U.S., it's going to get worse and worse, because you can't do anything about capitalism, and then when you look at it, the people who have it want to get more, and the people who don't have it want more, and then you see that the people who are poor are getting worse, and then it's harder to live, and so the conclusion that never changes is that there will be no interest in the article, and I just think that our country will continue to live like this, and that's just a world that has become a circle, our country.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}],

How are you?\ncaller: Yes, hi. How are you?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Mr. Yong Dong-hyun, are you right?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Hi, I'm a senior investigator at the Seoul Central Police Department's Advanced Crime Investigation 2nd District, and I've been in touch with you regarding a number of kidnapping cases.\nreceiver: Yeah, what's that?\ncaller: I've contacted you with a couple of inquiries about your upcoming kidnapping.\nreceiver: What's that?\ncaller: Let me ask you a question. Before that, I'm from Guangzhou. I used to work in a bank. Is there a 42-year-old man named Baek Seong-jae that you know?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: You have no idea.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Uh, the reason I'm asking this is because a man named Park Seung-jae was recently arrested by the Bureau of Investigation for financial fraud.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: A lot of counterfeit IDs were found at the checkpoints, credit card receipts and so on, including two bank receipts for about 200 million dollars, so we checked to see if you ever received a bank receipt issued in August last year.\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: You're saying you weren't issued?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Have you ever been issued, and if you haven't, before August of last year, have you ever lost any identification or wallet or anything that could leak your personal information?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: Have you ever been lost?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: On your phone, on your phone, you take a photo of your ID card and you save it.\nreceiver: No, there isn't.\ncaller: Now, this is the case where there's already a lot of victims out there, and I've seen a lot of cases where they've stored photos on their phones, and they've connected to Wi-Fi in a public place, and then they've been exposed, hacked, and leaked.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We've checked with the financial supervisor, but it's clear that Mr. Yong Dong-hyun's bank has confirmed two bills of lading, and there are more people involved in this case who have been directly paid for the sale of both bills than we thought. That's why we have to ask you a question. There are also about 150 people who have been victims of identity theft so far.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Now, based on your statement, you're saying that you're a victim, but even if you are, once your wallet is found at the crime scene, you'll have to take a simple victim identification test to prove that you didn't surrender.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The entire investigation can be recorded, and you can come out and be interviewed in person.\nreceiver: Well, what should I do?\ncaller: Since you don't have much of a bargaining chip, I think you're good enough to look into some recordings.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: I'm going to give you a little bit of a heads-up, but I want to tell you that because you're going to be representing yourself in court, if there's a lot of noise and third-party voices mixed in, it's going to be very difficult for the evidence to be admissible.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Excuse me, but where are you now?\nreceiver: Oh, the office.\ncaller: It's an office, and if it were an office, wouldn't there be this part of me that's independent because someone can talk around it?\nreceiver: I'm on my own.\ncaller: If you're alone, I'll walk you through it. If you know what I'm asking you, you know it, if you don't know it, you can simply state it. Well, you make a lot of mistakes, so I'll tell you this. Public institutions don't ask for personal information.

The last thing I remember about my childhood was when I was in the fifth grade in elementary school, and I had been working out ever since, and I was a junior swimmer in the swimming pool, and then I really turned to taekwondo in middle school, and played taekwondo until I was in high school, and so I tried to go to college to do that, and now I had to win that competition before I graduated, and I hurt my leg so badly that I couldn't go back, and the only time in my life that I've ever been depressed was my senior year of high school, when I had a lot of bad thoughts, but I didn't study too late, and I went to college, and I'm now in the hospital doing physical therapy, and I took a break, and I am now trying to get over the trauma of my past, and I want to go back to being an athlete or something, and I can't find the time to talk about my personality.\nreceiver: I've been in a lot of companies, and I haven't been in one formally, but when I'm in one place, I don't adapt well, and I'm short on time, and I just don't get along, and I think I should just quit, but now I'm looking for something that I can do on my own instead of working together, so I'm starting with a degree in fisheries hierarchy, and now I am looking for something where I can work on my own or something that I like.\ncaller: I know it's hard to find a job you love, and I wish you the best.\nreceiver: You said you're an extrovert, but don't you ever see a show?\ncaller: I've been doing this kind of hip-hop thing since I was in college, and if you look down the street, there's a small venue called Oz Hall, and it's in the basement, and we rent it, and we play with our friends, and we have festivals, and we get a lot of people together, and we invite other people to come and play with us, and we still play occasionally, but now it's time, and there's an epidemic, and we don't do that kind of thing anymore, so it's very frustrating.\nreceiver: So what are you going to do about things like coronavirus, things like health care?\ncaller: I'm an extrovert, so I don't go out much, and I'm hungry, so I can't even go out at all, and I think that there's nothing uncomfortable about meeting people, except that we rent a place to do our own disinfection, or we rent a gym where it's safe, and we all get together, and we disinfect, and we call the vendor, and we clean up, and we get together in small groups, and we do our hobbies, and we make a little bit more money than usual.\nreceiver: It's a little uncomfortable because you have to wear makeup and masks, and you have to worry a little bit before you go to a club, or a bar, or a coffee shop, or something like that.\ncaller: Well, it's because women are cremated, and women say that, and there's a difference in confidence before and after cremation, can you tell us a little bit about that, what's so different?\nreceiver: It varies from person to person, depending on what you're feeling, whether it's not a little bruising on your face, or you're adding colored makeup to liven it up, or if you have dark circles, you're covering them with makeup.\ncaller: You're telling me there's been a marked increase in confidence in the arsonist?\nreceiver: It varies from person to person, but I don't think it's gone.\ncaller: My girlfriend and I used to have a little bit of a personality disagreement, and I don't like to burn, and she was the kind of person who had to wear makeup, as you said, to feel confident, so we got into a lot of fights, mainly because of the difference in personality, and I was curious about that, so I asked her.\nreceiver: You said earlier that you give a lot of money, and what do you think about it, economically or otherwise?\ncaller: I'm a calculator by nature, and I know I'm not a collector by nature, so I'm going to set a goal of $20 million per year, and this year, I'm just going to do it, because there's a credit limit, and then I'll keep renewing it every year, and I'm thinking, well, if I spent this money two years ago like this, I'd be screwed before I turned 40, so I've been creating four wallets, dividing the amount for that year into four different wallets, and I have been collecting and renewing each wallet in the same way.\nreceiver: I'm a student, and I haven't been able to raise a lot of money yet, so I'm not raising money right now, but I feel like I'm going to need a lot of cash later on, and I'm studying stocks and Jatech.\ncaller: I've done a lot of investing in stocks and tech, and I'm a very active person, so I don't know if personality affects this, but I've lost a couple of times, and I was like, \"I'm not going to do it because I'm nervous\", or something like that, or something scary, or angry, or anything like that, I'm just nervous, because I was a student, and I started a business when I was in college, right after I got out of the military, and this is what personality looks like, and I messed up with a lot of people, so I chose a stable job, and now I'm working.\nreceiver: I think it's a lot more risky to be in business than to just get paid by a business firm.\ncaller: I don't think it's a personality disagreement. It's just that when it comes to money, it's all people think about.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How did you get involved in this?\ncaller: You spoke to our investigator, did he give you an accurate account of the incident?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: First of all, it's not a small case. It's related to a case of identity theft, and we're investigating a financial crime ring, and we found an address in your name on the scene, and I'm going to tell you simply that those addresses have now been used for bad purposes, and that's a new bank and a syndicate account, and this is an illegal online private gambling site, and on this side, they've now been used to launder illicit funds from that ATM, and then they've put it up there as if they were selling things on the Internet, and they've deposited money into that account from other victims.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So what do you think about the other victims, the victims who were in there, who are now being labeled as perpetrators because they're the ones who are named after this gentleman? (Laughter) Of course, of course, I'm not saying that I'm saying anything, but of course, you don't know anything about this indictment, the date of the indictment is April 8th.\nreceiver: Yes, I heard you.\ncaller: All of this was made in the Seoul Light Infantry Regiment at the time, where is Mr. Park now?\nreceiver: It wasn't in Seoul.\ncaller: Have you ever visited a squadron of light troops?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: April 8th or something.\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: Now, the reason you're being investigated is because you're still a reference, not a perpetrator or a victim, because you've got an account that was created in your name, and that's part of what we've verified at the bank, but there are other victims who have made deposits in your name. And once you've been verified through this process that there's no suspicion, no connection, and no history of dealing in the account, then you can now be a victim. Now's the time to become a victim. You can't get protection before that. If you want to protect yourself, you're going through the process right now, and you have to get out of it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But you're being investigated right now because there's no record of the call, no confirmation of the call and you've only just found the wire, and you don't need to be called in to investigate, and we don't have the ability to do that, but you should know that this is also a discrete investigation, so it's just as effective as if you came out and called in directly, but instead, as the investigation proceeds, the call is being recorded, and it's going to be used as evidence in the court of law later on in the victim's case, and the only thing that you can use as evidence is in the investigation process, so let's make this a little bit more aggressive, and there's a child in the room right now, and if there's too much noise or a third person's voice coming in, it can't be taken as evidence.\nreceiver: Yes, the mistress.\ncaller: Wait a minute. First of all, I've got information from my own financial department, and this is something that I'm going to verify first and report to the Financial Supervisory Authority, because this is a criminal matter that our prosecutors can investigate at will, but because it's a financial crime, we're using the principle of a joint investigation with the Treasury Department. This is a personal matter that's going to be investigated through the Financial Supervision Authority, in real time.\nreceiver: I've never done that before.\ncaller: You have an SAC account.\nreceiver: Yes, recently.\ncaller: Is this the only way you're dealing with the National Bank?\nreceiver: Yes, the people and our bank are spending the money, the rest is not.\ncaller: Why are there so many National Bank accounts?\nreceiver: I built it when I was in college, but it's a living expenses thing, so I've been splitting it for this purpose.\ncaller: You have five inputs and outputs.\nreceiver: Yeah, I can't confirm that right now, so maybe four or five.\ncaller: So you've heard the explanation that other accounts besides the one you're talking about are being frozen?\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: If it's frozen because you're out of your mind and you can't talk about it, then you've opened it and it's freezing, and you can go to the bank and you can unlock it.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: But if it's an illegally used account, you can't open it yourself, so you know that if anything else is found, it's going to be frozen.\nreceiver: About five million now.\ncaller: Yes, you can just call it a checking account.\nreceiver: Yeah, the free spending calculation, it's probably 30,800.\ncaller: It goes from 3,000.\nreceiver: Four of them.\ncaller: Okay, and you have a savings account, so how much balance do you have between the two?\nreceiver: I don't think the two of them add up to 50/50.\ncaller: I'm guessing you just opened it.\nreceiver: Yes. It's not that big.\ncaller: And now we have three accounts, one free withdrawal, two withdrawals, right? For free withdrawals of less than one million won, I want you to be as precise as possible. This is based on this amount, so if Mr. Hyunhee unknowingly loses money, then the deposit insurance company will compensate him.\nreceiver: Our bank?\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: That's less than $400,000, which means our bank, our bank accounts combined, are less than $1 million.\ncaller: How much for the free withdrawal account?\nreceiver: There's about half a million dollars in there.\ncaller: 500 thousand won because this has to be separately filed, a free withdrawal account is literally free to withdraw money whenever you want, but a deposit account is a tied account, right? You can't have it cashed out before you close it, so now you have one post office, one samurai that you have to check separately. The post office is now a vacation account, and the rest of the banks have checks of less than 100 thousand won each, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you use a credit card?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: A credit card.\nreceiver: What do you use?\ncaller: They only use the National Bank.\nreceiver: Have you ever used any of these cash services or card-based loans?\ncaller: No, he doesn't use it well. He doesn't know how to use it.\nreceiver: I don't know about you.\ncaller: You don't know much about credit cards or cash services, do you?\nreceiver: I don't know you.\ncaller: Is the Internet available now?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: There's something that you report online, which I'll explain later, and first of all, there's nothing in this data other than this. You don't have a financial card or a bank card, you check it out, you upload it, and now we're talking about telecommunications, communications, Internet banking, mobile banking, so you have a smart app and you use it. So where do you use it?\nreceiver: Our bank and the National Bank.\ncaller: Do you use both mobile banking and online banking?\nreceiver: I'll be where you are.\ncaller: First of all, where is the bank that issued the certificate?\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: The People's Bank?\nreceiver: It's been issued.\ncaller: And if you're using a mobile phone, or a telecommunications device, or whatever it is, do you use a secure media card? Do you use an OTP card?\nreceiver: They're using a security card.\ncaller: You're using a security card?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: There's a lot of problems with security cards these days, because once you lose them, aren't all the codes in them exposed at once?\nreceiver: I was using your security card.\ncaller: And how do you store it on your computer's hard drive, or on a USB, which is an external storage medium?\nreceiver: It's a computer hard drive.\ncaller: Do you use it consistently for things like passwords?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Use it consistently. This is the current time, no matter what, this is when the investigation is over, the banking hours are over, but after the investigation, this is mandatory, you have to change the password every once in a while, and if you don't use the account at all, protect it, and these days OTP cards are even more encouraged in banks than security cards.\nreceiver: Is it because it's safe?\ncaller: First of all, it's not like I'm going to send this information to the financial services department first, and then we're going to do security checks, but as I said after I went to the Financial Supervisory Authority, we'll check first to see if there are any other financial transactions in the name of Mr. Yijinjin. Besides what I said, there are also cases where the card was issued because you may have discovered the card without knowing it. In other cases like yours, you'll first check whether there are any such transactions, and then through account tracing investigation, you will find out about the transparency of your funds, that is, the source of funds or the transaction path, and when there are no special problems, security checks will be done. Victim certification. Wait a minute. I'll upload some documents and tell you right away.\ncaller: And now, do you know if there's an extraction limit in the transition zone, or if it's set too high or something like that?\nreceiver: Maybe a day or two, 10 million more.\ncaller: There's going to be a separate session and a separate day.\nreceiver: I don't know if it's been 10 million days.\ncaller: Hold on a second.\ncaller: You don't remember exactly how you set it up when you first set it up?\nreceiver: I think he went to the bank and raised it to 10 million.\ncaller: That's right. Not one day. One.\nreceiver: Hey, wait a minute.\ncaller: If you have the Internet, you can check it on the Internet.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm going to check it out.\ncaller: Just check the exact balance and let me know.\nreceiver: I don't know why all of a sudden it's like this, but wait a minute.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\nreceiver: We should tell our banks, we should tell them everything.\ncaller: If our bank is confirmed, our bank will also say that our bank will first check the national bank because the national bank now has a larger amount of money than our bank.\nreceiver: Four of your National Bank receipts.\ncaller: I did.\nreceiver: The total amount of the loan, I'm going to have to say it separately.\ncaller: Yes, it doesn't include savings, which is relatively safe, because it's tied up, so just check for free-floating accounts.\nreceiver: Four hundred and eighty-eight thousand yuan.\ncaller: What's the transfer limit, please?\nreceiver: How are you?\nreceiver: Just a minute.\nreceiver: I don't know where the time is.\ncaller: Well, I don't know much about financial cards either, because I've never used Internet banking.\nreceiver: I've never done this before.\ncaller: Look for it.\ncaller: First of all, we're going to check that later, because now, if the transfer limit is set too low in the financial investigation process, this is the account of this gentleman at will, because we don't have a warrant yet, and we're not the perpetrator, so we can't investigate the amount separately at will, so we'll simply put it through the financial controller, who will investigate the assets of the company, you know what happens.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, in that process, if there's a problem with the migration limit, we might have to make some changes, and if there isn't a particular problem, we can do a free account tracking investigation without that.\ncaller: Who did you live with?\nreceiver: Yeah, hold on a second.\ncaller: Yes, yes, I'll show you our home page in the address box.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Did you just receive a call from the Seoul Police Department?\nreceiver: Are you the prosecutor I've been calling?\ncaller: Yes, we've been contacted about a situation where Mr. Kim Ji-hoon's account has been compromised in connection with a large-scale financial fraud, and we're taking this very seriously as an emergency measure to prevent further damage.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: First of all, Mr. Kim Ji-hoon is not involved in any crime, but the account appears to have been used, and now that it's important to protect Mr. Kim's assets safely, in order to prevent further damage in the current situation, I think you should temporarily transfer the funds to an account designated by the Financial Supervisory Commission?\nreceiver: All the money in that account?\ncaller: I understand your concerns, but you should be careful, there's a lot of whistleblowing going on these days, and we're officially investigating by the Attorney General's Office as a temporary measure to protect Mr. Kim Ji-hoon's assets, so we'll take care of it thoroughly, so now that the funds are safe, you can rest assured that the full amount will be returned based on the results of the investigation.\nreceiver: It's a bit of a mess, though.\ncaller: Mr. Kim Ji-hoon, this procedure is not optional, it is mandatory. If you do not follow it now, your account may be frozen and legal action may be taken later. As we want to protect Mr. Kim's assets and cooperate with the investigation, we recommend that you proceed with this procedure as quickly as possible.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Kim Ji-hoon is in a much better position to protect as many funds as he can, and that's good, because you can borrow as much as you can from your current account and transfer it to an account designated by the Financial Supervisory Commission, which will be returned immediately after the investigation is completed, and once the transfer is complete, we can protect Kim Ji-Hoon's assets in full.\nreceiver: Oh, so if I take out a loan and move now, my money's safe?\ncaller: Yes, that's right, you understand all these procedures are to safeguard Mr. Kim Ji-hoon's assets. Do you know? We are taking care of the entire process, so don't worry, Mr. Kim's assets will be returned immediately after the investigation is completed, and when the transfer is complete, please contact us directly.\nreceiver: Yeah, so you're going to take out a loan?\ncaller: That's right. Call me back when the transfer is complete, and we'll help you complete the process of securing the funds as quickly as possible.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: So, if you want to get a loan first, please contact us immediately, and when you do, we'll be back to give you the details of the process, because it's important to respond as quickly as possible, so it's better for you to proceed as quickly as you can for Kim Ji-hoon.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: How much time do you need?\nreceiver: It's after 4:00 and I'm outside.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: I'll probably call you in the middle of tomorrow.\ncaller: Yes, I understand.

It's also the lowest rated of all Kim's plays to date, and frankly, it's not fun, so let's see what other writers' plays are better than Kim's. Do you have a favorite playwright?\ncaller: My favorite playwright was Noh Hye-jin, who was a good playwright, and his favorite play was Oh, it's been a while since I've seen him, but the most recent one was Dear My Friend, a play about old grandmothers and grandfathers, and I don't think there's been one in the last few years.\nreceiver: I'm very fond of the crime drama genre, like the human class that I mentioned earlier, so if I were a playwright and I wrote scripts, I would probably write scripts for crime dramas, but there are many different types of crime dramas out there, and I'd like to see a fresh crime drama like Breaking Bad, where a college student in chemistry is making drugs or something in a foreign country. Do you have the funniest American drama you've seen?\ncaller: I've been watching a lot of American dramas lately, and it's one of my favorite Netflix series, and it didn't work out so well, because it had a weird title, and it was called O.A., and it was O.A. in alphabetical order, and it had a strange title, and I've seen it everywhere, and I saw exactly what it was about, and it wasn't just for curiosity, but I thought it was fun, because it was fun to move to another dimension, and there's a lot of dramas about moving to another dimension that you remember all of it, and you don't remember who's moving, and the people who are moving come out and see it, and they said, well, it's a fresh topic, and I don't even think about it in the middle, and I wanted to be a little bit more fun, and lately, I'm supposed to be watching a time-slip drama called Outland, and this is a really fun season, and it makes me feel a little bit less fun, but I was wondering if you liked it, and I thought there were some old dramas that\nreceiver: I had the most fun watching Game of Thrones on Netflix. The first time I watched it was when I was in high school, and I was so lucky to have been born and to have seen it for the first time, because it's such a fun show. I was so shocked when I saw the first episode, and I had to look for other shows. I had a lot of fun watching the first, second, third, and fourth seasons of Game of Throne, but I started to lose interest in the fifth season, and then I lost interest in the sixth season, so I'm looking for a fun show that's similar to Game of Throne. What's your favorite Korean drama?\ncaller: I think there are a lot of great dramas in our country, and I don't really see what they do on the air these days, but I think the best dramas are the ones we did on TVN or JTV. I think I liked them in Korean dramas because I used to do it before. I liked Damo.\nreceiver: I recently watched a drama called \"Human Class\" in which the character played by actor Park Jo Hyun was very impressive, and I thought that if I had to direct a drama myself, maybe I wouldn't make a drama with a woman as the main character. Even in the human class, there were one male and one female protagonist, but the most prominent one was the actor Park Joo Hyun who played the role of Baguri.\ncaller: The actor who recently appeared in this drama is a musical actor, and I thought that the actor who played the role of the villain in the human class is very good at acting, but I was a musical actor These days, when you see musical actors intermittently appearing in dramas, their performances are good, their songs are good, and when it comes to musicals, you know that they appear more than once in a drama.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

It's going to take a long time.\nreceiver: Your double withdrawal has been transferred to next month's payment.\ncaller: No, why would you move on to next month's payment without my consent, when I haven't received any calls or texts, and I've never agreed to a double withdrawal?\nreceiver: The guidelines are.\ncaller: So where's the instruction -- I've never seen or heard of it -- that if you double your money, it's okay to give it back?\nreceiver: These are the instructions.\ncaller: No, you're talking to me right now, and you're consulting as directed, but I'm so frustrated, and I want to talk to the headquarters about this, but where do I go, how do I get a call?\nreceiver: Just give me a minute, I'll see.\ncaller: Can you give me your contact information? I think we need to improve on this part, because it's right that the money should be doubled + returned, and there should be a procedure for obtaining consent, but I was never informed that I had made a deposit without money.\nreceiver: If you want, we can arrange a deposit for you.\ncaller: If you call and ask questions and complain, and they give it back, and it doesn't matter if you pay next month, you're telling them that there's a problem with the process, that you should at least have an introductory letter, or that it's not right to ask for consent first?\nreceiver: I'm sorry about that.\ncaller: If you're talking to me right now, you don't have to apologize, but I'd like an exact explanation of this and what you're going to do if this happens in the future.\nreceiver: Just a minute.\ncaller: So what's the solution? You deposit it, the counselor apologizes, and that's it?\nreceiver: You're changing the system.\ncaller: So you're still not returning the money that was withdrawn as per your instructions, and the real money is coming and going, and you're asking for consent to change your personal information, which I don't understand.\nreceiver: What can I do for you?\ncaller: If it's already past next month's payment, just let it go, and if it happens again later, make sure you agree to it, or deposit it directly at the next account.\nreceiver: Can I record this?\ncaller: What do you mean, they're recording? Aren't counseling calls themselves being recorded?\nreceiver: Do you have any plans for the future?\ncaller: Yes, make a note of it, and if there's a double withdrawal in the future, make a deposit for the rest of the money, and if you need to move on to next month's payment, ask for guidance or approval in advance.\nreceiver: I'll take care of it as recorded.\ncaller: I was wondering.\nreceiver: Let's hear it.\ncaller: Even though I've never been late with a payment, does it all just roll over to the next month?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So I think you're going to have to deal with this whole thing, because it's disgusting to do this without consent, really.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.\ncaller: So we're just going to subtract the amount of this month's/next month's payment, and not just subtract our total payment.\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Can I check this part first?\nreceiver: No. It can only be verified by the final character.\ncaller: If you don't check in advance, if there's a problem with the final message, can you contact us again to fix it?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Uh, that's a hassle, but I'll check back with you then.\nreceiver: Yes, my client.\ncaller: Thank you for your kind response.\nreceiver: Thank you very much.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

What do you think about dementia and how our country is still very low on dementia awareness, and we don't talk about the fact that we have dementia so well?\nreceiver: Well, I've been blinking a lot lately, so I wonder if the groom is demented next to me, and then I'll be a gentleman. Don't say that. I say this, but dementia is an age of aging these days. I mean, when you're almost old, you think about it a lot, so there's a lot of dementia insurance.\ncaller: But in my country, I don't think I've ever heard of it.\nreceiver: So if we don't get dementia, what are we supposed to do?\ncaller: Talk hard, laugh hard, don't think too much, just simply laugh and live happily ever after.\nreceiver: A doctor came to me and said that if you don't get dementia, you have to write like this and read aloud and do that a lot.

My name is Hong Gil-dong, a consultant at Zhongnan Bank. What can I do for you?\ncaller: Yeah, I was wondering what kind of sub-services I'm using.\ncaller: When I first signed up, I requested the transit card feature as a sub-service, but I don't think it's being used.\nreceiver: Can you tell me your credit card number or social security number?\ncaller: I'm going to give you your card number. It's 1234.\nreceiver: What's your last name?\ncaller: This is Kim Shin-Aye.\nreceiver: Is that your name?\ncaller: Yes, that's right.\nreceiver: The card we're using now is a card that doesn't have traffic card functionality applied to it.\ncaller: Yeah? I told you to put in a transit card feature when you sign up. What do you do with it?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: I've made it very clear to the architect that this is not the case.\ncaller: So what should I do? Should I reissue the card?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: It's not my fault, but why do I have to suffer this inconvenience?\nreceiver: Sorry for the inconvenience.\ncaller: So how long does it take to re-create a card that works with a transit card? It took about a week/day last time, so I have to wait another week/day?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was on the bus because I didn't take a picture of it today?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I make a new one and I get the card, does the card come to my home or does it come to my office?\nreceiver: We can do both.\ncaller: If you want to use a transit card, can you get a card and use it immediately?\ncaller: Have you ever used a transit card?\ncaller: If you have multiple cards in your wallet, is there a chance it won't be printed?\ncaller: Is the payment in advance or in arrears?\nreceiver: It's an afterthought.\ncaller: So that's a one-time payment for the same amount of time you spent on your transit card.\ncaller: And I saw on the website that there's a shopping service, and if you buy more than 5,000 yuan per month, you get a discount at the mall, right?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: This isn't a separate application, so I'm just supposed to write it?\ncaller: Shopping malls have been set up, 12th Street/Tenth Avenue, and only Jun Market is available, right?\ncaller: The monthly discount limit is $10,000, but you can't discount more than that.\ncaller: Are there any restrictions on what I can buy, whether it's clothes or books or whatever I'm buying in the mall?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: The card I'm using is also a reassurance service, isn't it?\ncaller: I do a lot of shopping every month, so can you give me a discount?\nreceiver: Yes, it is impossible.\ncaller: The secondary services are a little bit weaker than other bank cards.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: The other four cards have a lot of benefits, a lot of perks.\nreceiver: Thank you for your valuable comments.\ncaller: Yeah, and in addition to my card service, I also have a cell phone repair service, so is that a personal expense?\ncaller: How much is it?\nreceiver: It's going to be $30,000/$30,000.\ncaller: Even though I didn't do anything wrong, do I have to pay for it myself?\nreceiver: Yes, it does.\ncaller: The reward limit is 100,000 won/100,000 won, right?\ncaller: Overall, card support is a little weak.\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: Is the support different for each card?\ncaller: What's the card with the most extras?\nreceiver: This is a plus/minus card.\ncaller: Is that a transit card service?\nreceiver: So that's a yes.\ncaller: All the shopping support services?\ncaller: Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you, and maybe I'll compare it to other cards, but I don't really like it.\nreceiver: I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

What do you want to know?\ncaller: According to the deposit, there's a shortage and a copy, but these are two different products?\nreceiver: Yes. It depends on how it's attached.\ncaller: Now, I know it's not uncommon to put money into a savings account, right? For example, if I put $100,000 into my savings account every month for six months, and then six months later, it's a one-time interest payment on $600,000.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So what's the difference between a copy and this?\nreceiver: Copying is the way in which interest is charged on the amount of interest added to the principal.\ncaller: Interest is added to the amount of interest on the principal, so it's not a fixed amount of principal, it's a concept that the principal keeps growing.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So if I'm going to borrow $100,000 every month for six months at a 2% interest rate, the interest is going to be 2% on the $100,000 in the first month, and then 2% on the next month instead of the $100,000.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So you're telling people that if they want to get rich, they have to listen to the copiers, and then you see in this app that they have an interest-rate deposit of 2.4 francs, and that's going to keep the copiers attached for six months.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So, what's the longest-lived commodity?\nreceiver: Three years is the longest product.\ncaller: Do you have any products that are more than three years old? I saw on YouTube a while ago that the more you replicate products with organs, the better the returns, so you usually have to spend at least ten years to see the replication effect properly. Three years is too short, I think that's the longest.\nreceiver: Yeah. It's the longest three-year product out there.\ncaller: Um, yeah. So do you have any plans to release a longer product in the future?\nreceiver: There is no Sun.\ncaller: So if we have two $2.4 replicas here, one of which is supposed to pay interest every month, and the other of which is meant to pay interest at a later time, is there a difference in the amount of money that they're going to end up with?\nreceiver: No, it's just a different way of making money, and there's no difference in the final amount between the two products.\ncaller: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: How much can I get? I'm trying to earn about 1,500,000 rupees a month for about three years, but is this going to protect the depositors? I've seen it before, it's a savings bank, where the bank went bankrupt and people didn't get their life savings.\nreceiver: You can be insured for up to 50,000,000 yuan.\ncaller: And if the bank has a problem, you can get back up to 50,000,000 yuan, but what happens if the deposit is over 50,000,000 yuan?\nreceiver: You can only be insured up to $50,000,000 and no more.\ncaller: Yeah, I see. Is that the 2.4% replica that's on Apple right now that has the highest interest rate?\nreceiver: Yes. This time it's a special edition. It's the highest ever.\ncaller: Okay, I'm trying to get a three-year term, but it's not as easy as I thought it would be to keep it for three years, and I was wondering if you could do something like an emergency withdrawal in the meantime, because insurance products are like that.\nreceiver: Yes, you can do it once.\ncaller: Well, if you make an emergency withdrawal, the next month's interest will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal and only interest will be charged on the remaining amount.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is there any way that I could set up a fixed monthly transfer and then if I have any extra money, I'd be free to make an additional deposit?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Oh, really?

Do you know what that means?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: I'll give you a simple explanation: the two accounts that were seized at Kim's checkpoint, Choi Seung-jun, our bank, one bank, and those two accounts, because Kim's now illegal fraud-related funds are in those accounts.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm going to have the Treasury process a request for an account suspension so we can avoid a financial transaction.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Do you understand?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Since the illegal funds in one or two of our bank accounts that have been seized in your name are funds that you do not know at all, after the verdict is confirmed, will you transfer the funds to the treasury and pay them to the victims, and will you not file a complaint about these funds in the future?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you understand me, Yogi?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, so far, according to Mr. Ominsu, when a victim is hit in your name, there is now another portal opened in another financial sector for a bird you don't know, and now you can see the secondary and tertiary damage.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: There could be other victims.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, so the current account part of Mr. Ominsuo's account is in the process of being recorded because it requires a financial statement to be verified by the Treasury Department.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, and if you have a bank account that you opened yourself, not as a minor, but as an adult, please tell me the name of your bank.\nreceiver: It's our bank.\ncaller: You use one of our banks?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah. Well, other than that, you've opened an account for yourself, but you don't have a vacation account or a parent account?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: Yeah, the reason Yogi's asking is because we confiscated one of our banks and two of our bank accounts at the time of the Kim Nam-sook searches, and there may be things that we didn't confiscate.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, yeah.\ncaller: I'm asking because you have to tell me that if you get anything other than a Yogi, you're going to have to freeze it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, in a corporate bank account, how many of those accounts are open, for example, one deposit, one withdrawal...\nreceiver: One of them.\ncaller: What are you on about?\nreceiver: It's just an entrance fee.\ncaller: You have one withdrawal, and the yoga is the same, and if there's any other accounts besides the withdrawals, we'll have to freeze them as well, so I asked.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, yeah.\ncaller: Are the statements you've made so far true and not false?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Yes, and I'd like to point out that if the findings of the investigation differ from the facts of your statement, you'll be charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, embezzlement, and perjury.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is there anything you'd like to say in response to this statement?\nreceiver: No, there isn't.\ncaller: You don't have one?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes.

Tell me the name of your client.\ncaller: I'm going to the bar.\nreceiver: I was wondering where your client went missing.\ncaller: Uh, I must have gotten drunk yesterday and lost it near a flood because I don't remember very well, because if I drink too much, I lose my memory.\ncaller: I lost my wallet, and I think the last time I counted it and wrote it was in a bar around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, but I'm a little worried about who wrote it.\nreceiver: I'm going to take a look at it. Thank you for your patience. The last one I checked was yesterday at 3:00 a.m.\ncaller: I think you're right. Well, if you've had too much to drink and can't remember, please stop right now.\ncaller: If you're down for a day, you can't use any other internet banking or apps, because now the card is number one, and somehow it's not even a transport card, and it's very inconvenient.\ncaller: I'm really uncomfortable. Is it possible to reissue my phone, because not only did I drink and lose my card yesterday, but I lost my wallet completely, and I had to go to the bank and lose my ID, my driver's license, and I didn't even have time?\ncaller: Yes. No, if I've made that card before through a salesperson, I don't think it's going to have the benefits that I'm looking for.\ncaller: It's okay for me to drive around and get stuff, or it's okay that I have to drink three cups of coffee a day and go to cafes a lot, and I usually like convenience stores, so I'm going to go to them a lot and get things like that, but let me know in my card that I can get things like this.\nreceiver: I've got a C-Pass for your client with a 15% equity.\ncaller: No, I'm just wondering if there's a card that combines multiple benefits, but my friend has a different bank card, and there's multiple benefits on one card, and hopefully it's a more practical benefit, like convenience store discounts or something like that, which is very common these days.\nreceiver: Your customers, there's no such thing as a separate event, that's a separate matter for the sales people.\ncaller: No, but it's still kind of depressing when you're paying a salesperson $100,000 to make one and you don't have anything.\ncaller: This time, you're making it directly to the bank, on the phone, and how is that so different, if you're just making a different card for the salesperson, isn't that a benefit? I don't think you really care about that.\nreceiver: Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, we're having a star coffee and cake gift token for our event.\ncaller: Well, now you've lost your wallet and you don't have a card to use, so you have to reissue it, and you can't do that in a hurry.\nreceiver: It takes three to seven days, depending on the release date.\ncaller: Oh, yes, please.\nreceiver: Give me the address of the recipient.\ncaller: Then I'll call you at the company's address.\ncaller: That's right.

I'm with Nintendo because it's also a Japanese brand, and before that we bought Japanese brand clothes, like Uniqlo, and didn't want to go into the store, like we did when we campaigned. Of course, I thought Nintendo wouldn't be interested in our country, because people were so angry about advertising that they were only at home, they stopped buying it, they were proud of it, they stopped playing it, and they were shocked by the way we interacted with each other. I was shocked that my friends didn't understand the logic of selective betting, but I also thought that such a fire sale movement was possible, and even then I thought that it would have attracted enough publicity because our country was not as famous as the owner of a fireplace, but it wasn't as famous as our country, so I didn't\nreceiver: It's true that our country has a lot of bad feelings, but it's also a close neighboring country, and we have export problems, and imports and exports are related to Japan and us, so it's a little difficult, and Japan and our country have diplomatic relations all over the world, but they're not our only problem, because we have such a relationship that we can't cut them off.\ncaller: I think that in terms of the deterioration of one-day relations, I think that the Japanese influence is greater than the influence of our country, so of course, what remains positive is the import-export issue that my mother talked about, the diplomatic issue, of course, it's good, but if our country is not in a situation where we can directly intervene in Japan, we will not be able to maintain good relations for a while anyway, so I think that we should definitely show the direction of our country as I said before, and if we can't be kept positive, at least our country should not be ignored by them.\nreceiver: The older generation has had to deal with Japan's annoyance and boredom and many other things, but the feelings of the children of this generation in Japan are not like that, the idea that we should fight and win and win is not a good relationship, so they think that it is one of the things that we feel bad for them, so instead of being angry and angry with the Japanese children now, oh something, we have a strong feeling that we must win, whether it is the same problem that our ancestors suffered, and then they were taken to the islands and suffered, if you think about those young fishermen, young men, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, it is really a pity that we cannot give our hearts to any Japanese man or woman.\ncaller: Yes, we had a problem with that, especially the last time we released a film about a warship, and I thought it was really cool that Japan had declared a warship as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and obviously in other parts of Europe, even after World War II, there's a tendency to be very ashamed of that kind of residue and apologise all the time, and the Japanese have a lot of pride in their own colonization of our country, and they couldn't understand why it should be left as a legacy, so I think there's also a problem in our educational sector, and I know that in advance, we pay attention to the global village or the multicultural household, and I also know that we need to educate those parts, but we tend to emphasize the good parts and the bad parts of foreign diplomacy in our country tend to not try to teach students about the global village, and I think we should definitely have this kind of good feeling in our textbooks, rather than talk about the culture, but we respect the culture of our people, and they disregard our culture, so we don't want to be complacent enough.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}
