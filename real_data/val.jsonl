The teller's at home.\ncaller: I'm going to give you a receipt for a million dollars, and you're going to see how much money is in the receipt, and of course they're just going to say, \"Oh, I have a million dollars in my receipt\", and then they'll say, \"Well, that's just a personal number\", and then I'll check to see if there's any money in it that I can use to find the money.\nreceiver: So we have to subtract everything?\ncaller: Once you've made a withdrawal, your account itself will be checked shortly thereafter by a financial supervisor, because I have to track how your identity is being stolen, so I'll put off checking and you'll have the funds now.\nreceiver: Take her with you.\ncaller: Yeah, so there's a process that you have to go through to verify your checking account, and if this process is already in progress and it's not in progress, well, how can we help you?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: I'm going to see if I'm a branch manager, but I'm not in the banking business, so I'm asking you to verify legally.\nreceiver: Oh, please.\ncaller: If possible, I'd like to apologize to my boss a little bit, but there's an emergency and I have to go out there now, and I think it's okay for me to go out and check on that move until next week, so I don't have to tell you what damage I want to see on your account.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: So I guess it wouldn't hurt to make the rest of the deposit.\nreceiver: But I'm talking about going to the bank.\ncaller: Yeah, that's not a good situation at all.\nreceiver: I can talk to him for a while.\ncaller: Oh, you can go out for a while?\nreceiver: I think we need to talk.\ncaller: What do you mean?\nreceiver: I need to talk to your boss, so I can get out of here.\ncaller: That's right, that's right. So first of all, I'm going to tell you that even if you talk to your boss, there's a third party, and you're the third party, but it's not a situation that I'm watching, but if you talk once, I'll come out again, or I'll go out for a while, I have to go to the bank to do some work, and I've been called for an examination, so it might be a little bit tedious because you might be worried about talking to your boss.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: So first of all, I'm going to take my time and talk to my boss for a minute, and if you look at what I've packed, it's not much, but I think it's a good idea to pack a bag when you're going to get your ID or your notebook.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: I'll give you a few minutes, but don't hang up the phone, and after you tell your boss everything, you can talk to me first.\nreceiver: Don't cut off the line.\ncaller: Yeah, so I'm going to continue with the recording.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: Yeah, I got it. Tell me when you get out.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, how about that?\nreceiver: I'm going to change, it's a work outfit, I think I'm gonna have to change and be a banker.\ncaller: You have to use some form of transportation to get around.\nreceiver: You can walk.\ncaller: How many times does it take?\nreceiver: It'll take about 15 minutes.\ncaller: And if you're worried that there might be some bad bank employees, I'm worried, and I'm going to prepare everything, and if you want to go outside for a little while, you can tell me right away.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Yeah, yeah, I got it.

Yeah, if you look around, is it in the Taiwanese bank note? Taiwanese banknote.\nreceiver: Yes, there is.\ncaller: It's not that far from the bank, is it?\nreceiver: I'm right next to you.\ncaller: I'm very concerned about the possibility that you might have a shortage of bank staff in your GCC bank account, because before checking whether or not you have a checking account, I'm going to check whether or not your CMA card is moving from your GCC banking account to your central bank account.\nreceiver: Oh, my God.\ncaller: There's money in the CAR bank account, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: It's the funds themselves, and it's all the deposits, right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I guess I'll just have to keep checking to see if I'm a sucker.\nreceiver: Oh yeah.\ncaller: So even if you have a deposit, you're going to have to put all of your own money into a deposit cancellation application.\nreceiver: Do I have to do it all?\ncaller: I'm going to tell you that in a few minutes, we're going to trace the account, and then we'll file a return request, and we'll do an audit, and if all the funds are found to be legitimate, and if there's transparency of the funds, then I'll personally, in the future, and now in the case of deposits, again, I'll make a deposit with the Financial Supervisory Authority.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, yeah\ncaller: So don't think about the Golan now, or me, or my parents, or what you're going to do to them, but the important thing is that you have to put in a request for termination of the deposit, because you don't have a receipt, because you didn't get a receipt when you came in, you have to get an application for re-issuance of your ID card, and after you receive the application, you have all the funds, all the funds from the Agricultural Bank.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Transfer all funds to your bank account in full.\nreceiver: The whole body?\ncaller: Yes, I'm going to do a full transfer of funds from the CMEA code to the mainstream bank, and I'll do some checking to see if the CMEA codes from the mainstream banks are still valid.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah, yeah.\ncaller: Yeah, you got it.\nreceiver: Yes, I got it.\ncaller: OK, and then you go into the bank, and there's a bad bank clerk, and if you're going to ask the question, \"Have you ever been investigated for robbing Mr. Yichengmin, or have you been investigated by the police?\"\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: So do I. Take as much time off as you can, and then put all your money in the bank's checking account, all of it, and when you're done, don't ever come out and talk to me in the bank.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: If you have a bad employee at the bank, we can make a recording, so don't make any more calls, and when you're done with your duties, and you're on your way to the main branch, call me right away, and I'll get back to you.\nreceiver: But first, you're going to reissue the receipt, and then you're gonna break it all down and deposit it into the bank's deposit receipt?\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: It's not too complicated, is it?\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Okay, well, I'm going to hang up the phone again, so when you get out of here and go to the ATM, just call me this way.\nreceiver: Where are you going?

Are you discriminating against me because I have low income and low credit now?\ncaller: I have a six-figure credit rating, I have assets, so what's my limit?\ncaller: Could you check the interest rate?\ncaller: Oh, yeah? Well, I guess we'll have to check it out.\ncaller: So what do I need to know in order to browse?\ncaller: My name is Kim Finance, and my social security number is 77777 88888.\ncaller: Have I been compromised? What's my limit? Is that a six?\ncaller: Why did you drop to seventh grade, which was obviously sixth grade, because of the tax money?\ncaller: Oh, yeah, that's right. It could have been the impact of the pre-tax loan.\ncaller: What about the restraining order?\ncaller: It's too expensive.\ncaller: You have a house and a car, 11%?\ncaller: You really can't?\ncaller: I can't help it, but it's better than anywhere else.\ncaller: Is there anything cheaper? The interest rate is too high.\ncaller: Do you think it's going to affect your credibility?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Then look at happy loans.\ncaller: What do you think?\ncaller: You have a house and a car, but that's all you get out of it?\ncaller: What's the interest?\ncaller: You really can't?\ncaller: And then we go to government-sponsored goods.\ncaller: So what's the monthly payment?\ncaller: Equal pay for equal work?\ncaller: Do you send bills every month?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: So if you don't send bills every month, where do you check?\ncaller: Oh, I'm supposed to know if you downloaded the app or checked it on the website?\ncaller: So you don't send invoices at all? How do you know? You don't have a contract?\ncaller: You're writing contracts on the Internet? You only send invoices once.\ncaller: Could it be anywhere, either at home or at work?\ncaller: Then I should go home. Can I change my address later?\ncaller: If I put in a contract, how long does it take to process it?

I don't know about Brazil, but it's a little bit more like this, not this kind of populism, but a little more valuable, and a little bit we think we're going to have to be a little bit smaller, and we don't think it's an artificial hypocrisy, and things like this, and now Brazil actually has so many stories that it's not very nice to look at, but I think that this president has taken advantage of that, and I think that's what's happening here in Brazil right now, because of the neighborhood.\ncaller: I don't think it's the far-right, but it's a social protest movement, and the idea that the social protest movement wants to achieve something revolutionary in this new, old-fashioned way, and because this president has come out to flavor it, he's going to send a little bit of support for that, and if you go through these things once or twice, I can't think of the name of the next big thing in Brazil, but I know that there are some very nice people who have shown up, and I know that these things, once socially, once they see a little revolutionary change, evaluate it, and then the people do it again, it will help the whole story to go on.\nreceiver: And I've been getting a lot of the feeling lately that history is going backwards, so it's really not as good politics as it used to be, because I think we're getting swept away, and it's a little bit too unstable and dark and kind of like, oh, what, do we have to follow the standard all the time, things like that? So it's very political, and actually, in the past, I don't really get involved in politics, and politics is politics, and I didn't do that, but these days, there are so many things that are directly relevant to us, and this is a case like Brazil, it's not like any other case, and I think it's the global trend, and you really think that it's going to get a little bit better in the future, and the next president, and I know it won't, but I think it will keep coming.\ncaller: In fact, in my country, in Brazil, in 2003, these two parties were elected, and after that, I know that there was a president who had the support of the people, of the left, and I don't remember his name exactly, but it's important that people feel that they're going through this kind of big change, that they've gone through this big change, and then they feel it again.\nreceiver: I feel that, uh, to some extent, we've all felt that the opposition has been in power once, and we want to feel it again, and we don't, and we've been in power again, and then we're going back and forth like this, and it makes me think that we're at a stage in the evolution of this history, but Brazil is so, uh, this is something, and there are so many problems on all sides of politics and economics, and I think it's going to be too hard for this one person to move all of those people's minds and be president, so this person right now, this person named Bozo O'Neal, uh, as president right now, is still very dominant right now, but still, uh, well, he's got a lot more support than any of the other supporters, so he's in the lead.\ncaller: We're a developed country, the only one, the most powerful country in the world, and the United States of America is now, in some ways, a mercenary, and in some ways it's a conspirator, and we have to see that we're living in a time when this guy becomes president, and yes, these people are the United States, and we thought we were the developed country, and Trump got elected, and this is what happened in 2019, and after this decade, Brazil is actually economically and politically far behind the United States.\nreceiver: And I think we're living in a time when it's so hard to predict how the future will look like, so compared to the United States, Brazil has a lot more problems, but at one point, uh, its people still have this Boozonau, and at one point they have this party, and then you think this Bozonau is going to be the Social Liberal Party again, and then they're going to become the Labor Party again, but this guy's going to be China again, and Trump is going to say that, and now he's saying that again, and China is another generation, so what are we going to do about China?\ncaller: This is the United States of America, and this is Biden after Trump, and the Democrats are now behind him, and the Democratic candidate is probably going to be elected, so I think it's good that the Socialist Party is somehow neutralized in some way, and in that respect, I think it is good that the government is coming and going here.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

So I would like you to make sure that the service time is as accurate and without any false information, but I think there is a reason why you get a discharge and you should not use garbage in this kind of service, so I would like these people to comply with their service time properly. Despite not being eligible for the military discharge system, one person recently received a discharge from the military, how do you think about this?\nreceiver: I don't know why he was discharged or how he got discharged again, but at least the discharge means that his fraud was exposed, and that there's a system in place to accurately identify each person, make sure they're properly documented, and make sure they don't make mistakes, so that this doesn't happen again.\ncaller: I think very negatively about this, if you don't have a place to volunteer nearby, you can't help it, but even though there's a volunteer station right next door, and there's plenty of places to do volunteer work nearby, there are a lot of people who abuse this to fill up a little bit more volunteer time, or to fill up volunteer hours when they're not volunteering.\nreceiver: The President of the United States is a very important person to the country, and he thinks that it's really wrong for someone in that position to do things that are unconscionable and try to get an exemption from military service, and the more high-ranking and famous he is, the more conscientious he should be and the more determined he should be to defend his country, and this guy doesn't think that he is, and they think that other people are going to volunteer more, and there are a lot of people who volunteer, and the fact that someone in that high position has done something like that is a mistake that shouldn't be overlooked, and that these people are being punished for interfering with recruitment or violating the Civil Service Act.\ncaller: In my case, I think it's about reforming the legal system, improving the law, improving hours of service, making it stronger, making it more punitive, because I don't like it when people who represent this country use this weakness of the law to dig holes in it, and they make it look bad for the country.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

My friends who are going to the army now are the most envious of the shorter period of service, because the use of mobile phones or military equipment is becoming a little more modern and more up-to-date, and that's a very natural change, and I don't want to argue about it, but in our country, do you have to go to the army because of conscription, or do you just want to be a professional soldier because of recruitment?\nreceiver: I know there are a lot of women in the military right now, and my friends are women and things like that, and I think being a soldier is a job, and I've had the opportunity to be in the U.S. military once, and it has a lot of benefits, and it's so good, it's kind of separated from your country, but you're rewarding them with other benefits, you know, the low pay and I think it should be work, and if I say that our country is in a position where every citizen has to do that kind of military service, then I think, three days a week, I think, I think that any job, I think you have to do that for yourself, if you have a hobby, if you like to move, if you've got this kind of regulation, you have to be doing something regulated, and I don't have that kind of thing, and if you're an optimized person, you're going to be paid as much as you're supposed to be getting paid as a job, or at any rate, I think it's because of the current political situation in our country, and we're\ncaller: I think the position is electronic.

Of course, the length of military service is decreasing over time, but it's not important to reduce the length of service, but if you become a country where you can't go to the army, and because of the specificity of the South and the North, you're going to have to go, that's kind of scary.\nreceiver: You're talking about when it's mandatory, and I think that's where people go who aren't in the field, so maybe it's a little bit longer for people like the Navy or the Air Force, and I know that there are special forces to acquire jobs, and I'm opposed to that, but I think it's going to take about two years for them to acquire and embody a certain level of expertise to be able to say that they can play a role in protecting the country.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

And I've had a lot of conversations that have been interrupted, and I've experienced a lot of stress because of the pressure to keep the conversation going, so I want to be a little bit more inward-looking, and if you've ever had a difficult time because of your personality.\nreceiver: I'm a very insecure person, and I can speak well in front of my friends, but I can't speak my mind in front of strangers, and I just go along with what's going on, and I'm too focused on other people, or I get dragged into it, and I find that I don't have anything to say, and then I go home later, and I often get sick, and I think it's wrong, and I have a hard time being alone, because I haven't developed the personality to say exactly what I want to say.\ncaller: Well, I want to be remembered as a kind person who cares a little bit and doesn't hurt other people, so that sounds like you help a lot of people, and you have a lot of talent, and you know how to do this and that, but anyway, you do a lot of things, and you care a lot, and you think about other people, and so you enjoy being with them, and you want to spend more time with them.\nreceiver: And to fix it, I've been doing more presentations and sorting through my thoughts before I say what I'm going to say, but I haven't really made the effort to do that yet, and I feel like I need to make the effort a little bit more, so if you don't want to be intimate with someone who has this personality when you're making friends, I wonder what that personality is and why.\ncaller: Well, it's very difficult for me to be friends with people who don't keep their appointments, and I've been friends with a lot of them, and they're always late, or they don't show up at all, they cancel their appointments late, and things like that happen all the time, and I waste time and emotions every time, and it's been a very difficult experience, and they have a very bad history of being out of touch, and I don't really want to be friends anymore with people who cause those problems, and so I'm not really interested in having friends who are late, or who have no concept of commitment, and I wrote the same question.\nreceiver: I don't want to be friends with someone who doesn't just keep their promises, but also someone who is very self-centered and doesn't care about other people's feelings, who gets a little bit carried away and gets drunk and says or does things that hurt other people without thinking about how they feel, and then if you pick one thing out of your relationships or your social life, what do you think is the most important characteristic?\ncaller: It's not that I don't have a remarkable personality, but if I do, it's because I know how to read people's emotions, like my superiors or subordinates, my co-workers, my bosses, and I read their emotions, and I think about what I can do with those emotions to give them a little bit of care, which I think will help me a lot in my work life and in my future social life. Of course, I think that work skills and the personality to be able to apply them are very important, but I think that being able to take care of other people is even more important in a space where people come together, like at work, and I like my personality.\nreceiver: I personally don't like it very much because I think about it and I put it off a lot, and I don't want to do it, but I can't talk about it, so I want to change my personality, and I really don't really like my personality personally, and what do you think is better or worse between the personality that doesn't go through the filters, even if it hurts people, and the personality where you have something to say, but you don't say it back, and you keep it to yourself?\ncaller: Personally, I think it's better to have a friend who doesn't filter what they say than a friend who does, and if you've been friends for a long time, you'll know all my flaws, and you'll tell me about them, and I hope you'll help me fix them, and then I'll be a better friend, and I'll probably be a better person for that friend, but if you're a friend, you don't really know me, and I don't want to hear you criticize me or say bad things about me in front of me. What do you think a good character is?\nreceiver: I think it's very important that you have a kindness that thinks about people, but doesn't make up your own mind about yourself, and that kindness is the best kind of personality, because if you have that kind of kindness and that kind of spontaneity, you can be more fluid in your relationships, and you can win with your own personality, even if people make fun of you, and I think that kindness and spontaneity are very important.\ncaller: I know that the MBTI test itself has been around for a very long time, and in fact, I took it for the first time when I was in elementary school, and I've been enjoying it ever since, and every time I've done it, it's always come up with the same type, and the fact that it's this type of test, I think it's got some credibility because it's derived from my personality-based sentences anyway, but lately, I know that there are people who are too blind to the MBTI, and they're often judging others based on it, and I actually heard that in some companies, they're making the MBTI data mandatory when applying to companies, and I think that shouldn't happen.\nreceiver: I've never thought much about my own personality, but I think I've thought a lot about other people's personalities, and when I'm hurt or stressed, I'm always thinking about the other person's personality, like, what kind of personality is it that hurts me, or makes me feel better, or this personality, or that personality, and I'm saying this because I don't think it's a good idea to just judge someone's character on my own terms.\ncaller: Blood type personality has also been around for a long time, and I know it's a little out of fashion now, but in the past, I've been a huge fan of blood type personality, because it doesn't take much effort to interpret your personality into four types and tell you which one you belong to, so once you know that type, you know what that personality is, and you can compare it to your own personality, which I really like, but it's already been shown that blood type and personality don't really have much to do with each other, and since then, the number of people who believe in it has also decreased, and the accuracy itself, of course, is going to drop, so I think you have a very bad view of blood type personalities, and it's fun to look at, but I don't want to get too close to someone who believes in blood type character.\nreceiver: And as I said earlier, I don't like my character very much, and I think it's still a long way to go to meet the standards of good character that I've been talking about, so if I'm going to say that I have a good character, I think I need to try to emulate that good character a little bit, so I'll ask you the same question that you asked me earlier, and I'll say, \"Have you ever thought deeply about character, or other people's character, or your own personality?\"\ncaller: I'm very introspective about my personality, because when I have friction with other people, I've always wondered if there's something wrong with my personality and that's why I don't get along with others, and I've long wondered if it's because I've learned that in order to always be comfortable with myself, I'm comfortable blaming other people, but blaming others, even though I might be comfortable with them now, doesn't help me in my relationships in the future, so even when there's nothing wrong with me, I think a lot about why I'm having these thoughts, and what I'm getting out of thinking about them in the future.\nreceiver: Personally, I'm a huge fan and a big believer in empathy, because when I do a personality test, I don't know what my type is, and I'm like, \"Oh, that's right\", and it's fun to think about it and compare it, but I also think it's bad to get so caught up in empathy or that kind of personality test that you're trying to put a standard on other people and say, \"This is my personality\".\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How can I help you?\ncaller: I'd like to open a stock account, and I've tried many times, but it doesn't work, even though I do what I'm told.\nreceiver: Yeah, opening a stock account, you mean?\ncaller: Yes, a securities app on your mobile phone.\nreceiver: Let me show you how to do it on mobile.\ncaller: I've tried it many times, and I've even tried it on a computer, but it doesn't work.\nreceiver: I'll get back to you as soon as I can.\ncaller: Do that. Is it always this hard?\nreceiver: I'm sorry, I'll have to check in with you.\ncaller: That's right.\nreceiver: Please tell me the name of the state in which you live.\nreceiver: Thank you.\ncaller: Yeah, I've tried it, but I can't. Why is it so hard?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: In the App Store, I downloaded both apps, and in the stock account app, I created a stock account, but in the JSE app, they kept asking me to open an account, and I couldn't do it.\nreceiver: Do you have a share certificate?\ncaller: Yes, I have an official certificate, but I don't have my own.\ncaller: I've been to the accreditation center, and I don't have my credentials, and I'm obviously looking at my mobile banking, and I have no idea where to look.\nreceiver: Do you have any securities?\ncaller: Is the certificate different? I don't know. It's in a bank, so it's for a bank.\nreceiver: Did you get it from the bank?\ncaller: Yes, I got it from my bank. When I signed up for Internet banking, I installed my bank app and got a certificate, so I'm using all the banks on my mobile phone. What's different? Can you only use stocks for securities?\nreceiver: We need equity.\ncaller: So if you don't have a certificate, what do you do? If you use a broker, do you need a certificate of accreditation or a co-certificate for the certificate? Or is it a universal certificate, I think it's a fee? Does it cost money? Is there a fee for the use of the certificate?\nreceiver: It's free.\ncaller: So where do you get it? Do you get it from your computer? Or do you receive it from your mobile phone? When you get a certificate from a bank, you probably have to have an OTP.\ncaller: It's really complicated, and I don't know which app to get it from, but why do you open an account in another app, and that's not compatible? Why not?\nreceiver: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to go through the process of registering the certificate again.\ncaller: I'd like to do it on my mobile, but it's more convenient than on my computer, so please let me know you can do it on your mobile, and the shared certificate is free, right?\nreceiver: Yes, I'll let you know.\ncaller: In the mobile app, in the Authentication Center, where do you re-register after the shared certificate? I'm looking at the screen right now, and there's no way to register a shared certificate.\nreceiver: It doesn't.\ncaller: I've even got a shared certificate. Now can I register my shortcut password? Can I make it the same as my account password?\ncaller: Now I'm asking you to type ID and Viber, and you say, \"Do I have to log in to get the shared certificate?\" (too much) / (sniffles) It's a lot to type, but there's no easy way to do it? Other people say they just type in the shared certificate, why am I different?\nreceiver: Do it like this.\ncaller: Uh, here it is, but why are there two ways to get in?\nreceiver: This is different.\ncaller: When you order a stock, can you buy it from 1 week to 1 week?\ncaller: Do I have to pay the fees and taxes all at once, or do I miss them, and where do I see the realized gains after the sale?\nreceiver: You can see it here.\ncaller: But do you really have to pay a lot of tax if you have more than 300 million shares, or do you have to pay taxes if you have 100 billion shares?\nreceiver: Yes, this is different.\ncaller: So you're saying that people like me who invest in stocks with very little money don't have to worry about taxes?\ncaller: Yes, I see.

So I went on the Internet, and there's a bunch of work that I can do at home, and I couldn't design this, and I didn't know anything about computers, and I wasn't thinking about marketing, and I was wondering if I could do this kind of thing, and I said, well, I've only got to do it once a month, and then I'd have to do it again, and I would have to teach that kind of thing one more time a week, so I know that it's going to be a little bit overwhelming, and\nreceiver: You know, the company name at &address&lt;1&gt;, the fried house, opened on March 19th, and I worked for a month from March 30th to April 8th, and that's when I started working from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m., for a total of six hours, and I got the lowest salary of 8,590 people, and then I multiplied that by 12 hours, and now I've got the total, because there are so many guests, and now if you search the Internet, you'll just see blogs and reviews, and you'll have an open recipe, and then you'll buy people to blog about us, and then ask them to promote us, and they'll say, \"Well, here's a guest, and this blog is delicious, and this recipe is delicious\", and then they'll do that, and so we've had a steady stream of guests, so for six hours, I haven't been able to go to the bathroom or water, and I've never eaten fish or anything, but I've been counting fish at the counter,\ncaller: I heard about it, and it's usually hard work, and that's because it's a human relationship, and you're usually talking about it for difficult reasons, and then it's physical work, and you have both of those things, so it's going to be really awesome, and I thought, well, I'm just lucky that I've never had such a hard time in my life, and I don't think I've ever had this kind of hard work, compared to other people, but I've had my own hard times, and I've been so obviously unlucky that no one has ever seen me suffer a huge blowback, no one has seen me do a huge amount of physical work, but nevertheless, I've worked in a cafe for two months, and when I first started working in a café, I had a sister who was already working in a cafe when I started working with Gel &amp;

Didn't he sell it himself?\nreceiver: But, you know, financial transactions are based on the principle that if you want to open an account, you have to go to that bank yourself, and it issues an account, right?\ncaller: Now, you said you don't know, and it's not just a stupid thing to do, but you can understand and be upset, but this is a case where a man named Gangsang Ho, who runs an illegal gambling site, has contacted 130 people across the country, including yourself, stating that he has bought tickets because he needs a container, and we're on the phone, and some of you have been contacted by people who are getting paid to sell, but you've never sold anything.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: We're also investigating the case, and we've found that the bank, the insurance company, the card company, the telecommunications company were involved in this case, and according to the number of Busan Bank employees who are currently in custody, you can't rule out the possibility of creating a credit card or cash card with a duplicate ID or personal information and making illegal transactions with the gang members, because it's a genuine situation. And for the record, I want you to know that according to the law on punishing account holders, anyone who sells the note to someone else is liable to imprisonment for up to three years or a fine of up to 30 million yuan. So you're telling me that you have no idea what you're talking about and have nothing to do with it?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: Have you clicked on something like text messaging lately?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: First of all, since there are no charges in this case, I'd like you to be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.\nreceiver: Should we go now?\ncaller: Yes, please come right away.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Yeah, what time can you get there?\nreceiver: Looks like it's gonna have to be tonight.\ncaller: You have to be here by 4:00 p.m.\nreceiver: What do you want me to do?\ncaller: You don't know if you're a victim or a suspect, so you're telling us that you're being investigated by the prosecutor's office, that you have no knowledge of the case, and that you don't have any knowledge of the gangster.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But what is clear is that you have just appeared in the account of Busan Bank in the name of Mr. Kim Hyun-hoon, and this account is now frozen because it contains 80,000 illegal gamblers. And according to strong testimony, you have received the account of Mr.Kim Hyun-Hoon by smuggling and transferred it to your account in the future. So from the point of view of our Prosecutor's Office, you will tell us that there is an allegation of account surrender, and you say that you can appear, so you are not in Seoul right now?\nreceiver: It's not.\ncaller: You're not in Seoul. Yes. So you can be here at 4:00? Do you have a problem?\nreceiver: It's far away. It's not even close.\ncaller: Are you just saying that it's hard to come by on the street, or do you have a lot of issues?\nreceiver: It's far away.\ncaller: Are you at work or at home?\nreceiver: It's work.\ncaller: Oh, you're on duty. Is that what you're saying?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Oh, it's very hard for you to get out of the car. Is that what you're saying?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Yes, I understand what you're saying. First of all, since this case is involved, I'm going to ask you a few more questions to determine if you are a first-degree victim. This question is a question that asks you to reveal your identity.

It was a normal day.\ncaller: And if it's a weekday, do you have any colleagues who can prove that they worked with you on that day?\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: I understand what you're saying, but did you know before I told you that the current Kim Hye-hyun account was illegally used in the Gangshan-ho case?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: It's the first time, isn't it?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: At the time of your current legal transaction, were you dealing in undervalued bonds?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: You've never dealt with a Busan bank, so you're saying Busan doesn't deal?\nreceiver: I'm not negotiating.\ncaller: So, if an anonymous tip is found during our investigation, we'll admit that the criminals improved illegally on the data leak, and all funds will be forcibly frozen.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

And another thing, when I was in elementary school, I wanted a puppy so badly that I kept asking my mom to buy me a puppy, because I was going to buy a puppy for Christmas, and I just got a puppy and I've been living with it for about ten years now, and it's kind of weird to say that I'm actually giving you life, but it's probably the most valuable and memorable gift that I've gotten, because it's like, \"Oh, you're the most remarkable gift I got recently\".\nreceiver: I had a birthday party this year with a friend who had the same birthday as me, and now I've got my kids together, and they've been so generous with their gifts, and I've had these gifts in this huge drawer full of letters and pictures that I've personally attached to them, and I know all the things that I love, and I was so touched that my parents bought me these clothes and shoes that I want to have, and this is why this year, on my birthday, I'm going to make sure that the gifts that I get are the best and the most well-preserved.\ncaller: Now, if you're thinking about the gifts that you'd like to get, this is the new iPhone 12, and I would like to have it, but my phone is also an old model, and I have a lot of money, so I would love to have an iPhone 12, but it's expensive, and I want it, and I can't afford to buy it with my own money.

How are you?\nreceiver: Hi. How are you?\ncaller: Hello, my name is Kim Yeo-woo of the newly established KB National Bank.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, that's why I called.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Your client said he wanted to apply for a minus warrant, so I called the counselor.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Are you the client who requested your release?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, well, if you don't mind, I'd like to help you out with a little product description first.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, our National Bank Minus statements have gone from the lowest 3.7% of the pension to the highest 7.5%.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: The limit is up to 50 million won, and the limit and interest are applied according to the credit rating of the customer. It's a fixed-rate, no-interest-rate, five-year discounted bond.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Do you have any additional questions?\nreceiver: You're going to use it for five years without renewal?\ncaller: And if you do, and you do it well, you'll be able to renew for three more years at the end of the five-year term.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, yes, and that's a total of eight years' worth of negative equity.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: In the case of a conventional discount account, your interest rate fluctuates every year.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, yes, but in the case of our last-named Minus Inventory products, because they're funded by the National Welfare Fund, which is a government-backed product, there's no interest rate fluctuation at all.\nreceiver: No, I don't know.\ncaller: Don't you know?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah. Anyway, because it's a government-backed product, there's no fluctuation in interest rates.\nreceiver: Is this a new release?\ncaller: Is that right?\nreceiver: Is it a new release?\ncaller: It's been out for two weeks, sir.\nreceiver: Two weeks?\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: And then I'm gonna apply for this and see what the interest rate is.\ncaller: So, if you're a customer, yes, yes, I'll help you virtually with your search, but just a few simple questions, what does your profile look like?\nreceiver: It's the same number.\ncaller: You're a customer, aren't you?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: What about birthdays?\nreceiver: It was August 6, 1992.\ncaller: What about your client's occupation?\nreceiver: There isn't one.\ncaller: I don't know, if you're a customer, do you have any income?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: Oh, not at all.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Do you use a credit card?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: Don't use it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So if you're a customer, what is your type of accommodation?\nreceiver: Go to sleep.\ncaller: Is that your name?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: It's an apartment building.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Where's your apartment?\nreceiver: It's in the mountains.\ncaller: I'm in the mountainous area. Could you please tell me where it is?\nreceiver: It's going to be 101.\ncaller: What's the matter?\nreceiver: This is Davutoglu.\ncaller: Is this the Dawoo Apartment?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Is that your name?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'd like to help you with your virtual inspection, please wait a moment.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, you did.\nreceiver: Hi. How are you?\ncaller: Your client, you've been interviewed, and you've told us that based on the information you've provided, the virtual limit has been generated at a rate of interest of 4.3% per annum for 18 million won.\nreceiver: Uh, yeah.\ncaller: Because this is a virtual threshold, and it has absolutely no impact on your credit rating, please understand that the threshold and the interest rate can fluctuate when you go through the final approval process.\nreceiver: But that's all you have to do is get it examined, and then you have to get it back?\ncaller: Are you aware that any loan you take must be reviewed?\nreceiver: No, I did not.\ncaller: In the case of a review, we'll evaluate your paperwork and issue a denial of service order.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: Yes, yes, basically, any credit loan, the review is a mandatory part of the process, for you, the customer.\nreceiver: I'm not saying I won't do it.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: And I'll tell you exactly what the interest is, and then I'll get back to you on that.\ncaller: Oh, yeah, that part's right.\nreceiver: After the examination, I'm going to have to...\ncaller: Whether you will proceed...\nreceiver: That's when you make your decision?\ncaller: Yes, you can do that, sir, and then I'll help you with the paperwork in the morgue.\nreceiver: Yeah, how is it different now?\ncaller: No, you're looking at a 20% discount, which is incredibly typical.\nreceiver: So high and mighty.\ncaller: Oh, yeah, yeah, about twenty times that.\nreceiver: Why is it so low?\ncaller: The other part is that you don't have any proof of income.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, you don't get a loan in the traditional sense, where you're a customer, and credit loans are based on your income information, or whether you use a credit card, or your credit rating.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you say you don't have any income, the only thing the bank can verify is that when you give the loan, you can't repay it.\nreceiver: But then I got a call.\ncaller: It's your client.\nreceiver: You can't just take anyone like that.\ncaller: No, no, we didn't give you the phone part of it. It's not our bank, it's a government organization called the National Happiness Fund.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And what we do at your National Happiness Fund is we do community support and personal recovery, bankruptcy, personal insurance, all of these things, and you know, first of all, you're a customer, and you're very connected to the community.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, yes, and in the case of this product, it's a product that's being funded by the National Happiness Fund.\nreceiver: Well, that's because I'm taking out another loan right now.\ncaller: What are you doing?\nreceiver: That South Korean housing developer, Diddle.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm using that.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: Does that have anything to do with it?\ncaller: How much time do you have left?\nreceiver: I made a fresh start.\ncaller: How much do you have left?\nreceiver: How much?\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: Is it 100 million? That's what it is.\ncaller: You're saying there's 100 million of them?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Wait a minute, do you have any idea how much your apartment is worth?\nreceiver: I don't have a clear vision.\ncaller: Is that right, sir?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: Wait a minute, so you're more likely to go to the coroner's office and have your inquiries answered sooner than I do, because I can't tell you exactly what I'm going to tell you.\nreceiver: I mean, if it's a job that needs to be done...\ncaller: So if you're a customer, if you have the type of housing that I'm talking about, if you've asked for housing, if you own a home, especially an apartment, you're going to get it for a very long time, so you actually have a case of approval.\nreceiver: It's not just that, it's through your spouse... because you want it to be better.\ncaller: Oh, you go through your spouse.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, that's okay too, because if you say your spouse is doing it, you're practically in the approval process.\nreceiver: Well, how do I get in touch with it?\ncaller: You can contact me at this number, and I'll help you find Kim Young-woo's replacement.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Thank you.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Some of the bad employees have been investigated by our prosecutors, and according to their statements, that is, they used a duplicate ID card, a credit card, a cheque card, or a security card, and sold it to the Kim Tae Ho organization. But now the strange thing on our side is that, as you know, a bank account is not easy to create.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You have to go to a bank trial and you have to have an identity card or a forge or a signature, and normally you have to open an order, but despite this complicated process, the fact that this order was created is now suspected by us in two ways.

First of all, an official investigation means you have official documents. An investigation without official documents is fine if you don't cooperate, even if it's not the intention of the government.\nreceiver: So I didn't have to rely on anyone except my father.\ncaller: And are you currently employed or a student?\nreceiver: No, sorry about that.\ncaller: Please say yes.\nreceiver: Can you tell me who you are, where you're from, and if I don't know, can I call you back right now?\ncaller: Yes, yes, of course.

Can you feel that?\nreceiver: I don't think I've ever seen it in a big way, not in a supermarket, not in the aquarium industry, but I think I have never seen it in person, and I think it's because the seaweed farming is expanding and the production is increasing, but have you ever seen these facilities grow, either in the media or directly?\ncaller: I've been walking along the coast and I've seen this farm on the coast of Jeju Island, and I saw people fishing near the farm, and I asked them why they fished so much there, and they said, \"There's a farm\", and I found out that the price of mountain trousers has gone down a lot, but do you have any idea how much it went down?\nreceiver: The price per kilo, which was 67,000 yuan, 68,000 yuan, at the end of last April, in April 2018, it went down from 28,000 yuan to 29,000 yuan, and the price of soybeans dropped so much that it was in the news that the direct consumer price didn't suddenly drop.\ncaller: I know that the distribution system in our country is very complicated, so not only the seafood, but also the consumer prices of other foods, and even if the price of sandwiches goes down, the consumer prices go down so little or not at all that we don't notice, but instead, in restaurants, when the price goes down, they increase the quantity a little bit more.\nreceiver: No, I don't think I've ever seen one before. There's a lot of jackets and all kinds of seafood at the supermarket, whether it's shrimp or lobster or some kind of fish market that sells shrimps or lobsters or whatever, but I've seen it a lot, and I've never thought about buying a jacket and cooking it myself. Because of the economic downturn and the anti-money laundering laws, domestic consumption has slowed down, and the jacket is used a lot like putting 50,000 coupons in an apple box and asking for bribes.\ncaller: As far as I know, seafood isn't given as a gift like cash is. Seafood, especially turtles, sell out fast and smell bad. I know that in our country, the distribution system is complicated, and there's a lot of out-of-the-way trading on the Internet.\nreceiver: Yeah, I'm going to go to the mall, and it's cheaper and fresher than online shopping, but if it's cooked and good to eat, there's a difference in price. If some of those big-box stores are selling sweaters for less than direct sales, then of course I'm thinking about buying sweaters.\ncaller: I've heard that the number of farms is increasing and the climate in our country has changed so much that it's not as difficult to produce trout, to harvest trout than it used to be, and restaurants are popping up in tourist destinations, and there are a lot of people who want to consume them, so there's just as much production and more farms, so how can we keep the price of trout from dropping so much that the people who work in the fishing industry don't suffer?\nreceiver: It's a difficult question, how can we keep the price of seafood at the same level and make sure that the people who work in the fisheries get a fair wage, because I think it's been in the news that there are a lot of seafood farming facilities all over the country, and I think that the more they produce, the more they consume, and the more they export, and so I think we need to lead that trend so that there's a lot of this kind of seafood related dishes, recipes, etc. in the country, so that other seafood besides seafood will have an impact on the retail price.\ncaller: We know that the seafood that's farmed, not the shrimp, and we know that the people that produce it, they don't make much money off of it because the price of shrimp goes down as much as that shrimp. You work really hard at the farm, and so we know that there's a lot of people who are trying to do this kind of open market or shrimp trade more often. There's been a lot of shipping in Newark stores and Kelly markets, and the distribution structure in our country is not much less complicated than it used to be.\nreceiver: I don't think I've ever seen a big difference in the price of most foods, and even though the price of the ingredients has gone down, the price has stayed the same, or maybe it's gone up, or maybe the quantity has been adjusted to keep up with the price.\ncaller: I've been to grocery stores and supermarkets, and I've seen these stores that only sell stuff that's packaged in really big containers.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I like the three-layered part and the sausage part of pork, especially sausage, which is better than sausage, because it has less fat and therefore a lighter flavor. That's why among my favorite foods, my favorite meat part is sausage.\nreceiver: Yes, one of my favorite dishes is chicken nuggets, which have a lot of sugar in them, and I don't like the nuggets you buy at the market, because there's so much sugar in the dumplings, so I eat nuggets at home, and if you're wondering how to make nuggets for chicken, then I'll tell you my nugget recipe is: two tablespoons of erythritol, two tablespones of garlic powder, two tabspoons of liquid vinegar, one tablespoon of vinegar, and you can make a very tasty nugget that doesn't raise your blood sugar.\ncaller: Yes, I know there's a famous chicken turtle house in Chuncheon, and I actually ate chicken turtles when I first came to Chungcheong, but it wasn't a delicacy at the time, so it didn't taste any better than the turtles we eat in my hometown of Daejeon, so I haven't eaten much of the turtle chicken since then, but recently, I visited a turtle house called the Wooden House Chicken Turtle, which is a very famous turtles house in Chungcheong.\nreceiver: No, I don't eat fast food very often, but I like it, and I like hamburgers and pizza and chicken, and one of the things that I like about fast food is the burger king, with the tomatoes and the shrimp on top of the burger king.\ncaller: Yeah, I've only had a burger once or twice at Burger King, so I don't know much about it, but I've been to Lotte's, and I've heard that it's really good to have a burger in the middle of a burger, and there's a lot of bacon in the brioche, and it's a very thick patty with cheese and tomatoes on top, so it's one of my favorite dishes. name2 If you like pasta, what's your favorite pasta?\nreceiver: Yes, I like pasta very much, and of all pasta, I like cream pasta the most, because cream pasta is something that I like to eat rather than eat, but if you add sour cream and cheese and salt and pepper, you can have a delicious whipped cream pasta.\ncaller: Yes, I like pizza best of all because I can put whatever toppings I want on it, and that's why I often make it at home. I put a lot of cheese and tomato sauce in a tortilla, and then I sprinkle a little cheese on top of it, and then onions and paprika and bacon and stuff, and it's a really delicious pizza, and I can sprinkle so much mozzarella cheese on top that I make a lot of it myself, and I eat it.\nreceiver: Yes, I'm a big fan of breakfast, and there's a lot of delicious food in breakfast, and I really like things like sausage ramen doughnuts, and my favorite thing is sausage doughnut, which is a kind of cheese doughnut with a lot of cheese in it, so I like the western-style breakfast the best of all the Western-style breakfasts.

Do you like handmade gifts?\nreceiver: Yeah, I love handmade gifts, and actually, one of the gifts I got this year was this headband, and it's a site called Ideas, where these authors make their own handmade headbands and sell their own work, and the person who gave me the gift gave me a handmade headbang there, and so it's very memorable, and, well, it's now a practical headband, which I think was great, because, uh, and also, when I was at my parents' wedding, I bought a handkerchief from this place called Ideas.\ncaller: I tend to put the needs of the other person first, and if that's not the case, I tend to buy things for real life that I can use right away, like accessories and clothes and clothes, which are a little bit more practical, but accessories are the kind of dolls that you mentioned earlier, which are the most elusive, and flowers, like dried flowers, which are easy-to-manage flowers that I like to give as gifts, but I don't really like organic or plants that are difficult to grow and take care of right away as gifts.\nreceiver: On my fourth birthday, my sister and I had a surprise for my parents, and somehow we managed to do it, because my sister's recipe -- it's often on the Internet -- is a candle-shaped plastic that she uses as a dryer, and so I made a balloon, and I prepared the food and I surprised her by the time my parents got home from work, and in fact, my parents -- well, they've had a lot of experiences like this, and I think it was more exciting than it would have been at other times, so we were really proud to prepare this, and it was a really fun memory that we had with my sister.\ncaller: I wanted to go somewhere for my friend's birthday, so I wanted to do a chicken house or a restaurant, and I rented a party room, and I remember eating there and taking pictures, and it was in a warehouse, which was very cheap, and I also remember being very impressed by the fact that it was almost like a studio, and I thought, well, when you give a gift to a good friend, what do you think about the price?\nreceiver: Well, it's a little bit different depending on how close you are to each other, and your closest or best friend is thinking about $450,000, and your not-so-friendly friends are thinking about $20,000 or less, or at least $10,000, and they're giving you gifts in the form of emoticons or gifts, and I think that's what I'm doing.\ncaller: And I've seen that the price varies depending on the intimacy, and I've been thinking about $45,000 for a close friend, and I think for a non-close friend, I'm basically giving gifts to each other on that price line. And I'm pretty good at giving cocoa these days, so I'm kind of looking at it and giving gifts a lot, because it's very well priced, and it's got a lot of chicken and ice cream gifts these days, and if you use it, there's a lot of good prices and good quality goods, so you buy it with a little bit of price adjustment, and maybe next time you want to give someone a gift, what would you like to give them?\nreceiver: I'd like to give you some flowers, because I actually received flowers from my cousin on my birthday, and my parents didn't even think about it at the time, but my sister gave me flowers, and it was a very memorable and moving experience, and now every flower has a different flower head, so that I can convey the message according to that flower head. So I think if I'm going to give someone a gift, flowers are going to be the first thing that comes to mind.\ncaller: In the past, I've seen a lot of face-to-face gifts, but these days, with the rise of the Gypticon culture, I think it's more common for people to send messages and gifts through kakao chat, rather than face to face, so that even if I don't know my friend's home address, they have the advantage of being able to type in their home address and receive them at a time that's convenient for them.\nreceiver: I've always hated perfume as a gift, and I don't like it to be too pungent, so when I get a gift of perfume, I think it's a little bit less practical, and that's the reason why I tend to avoid it when I'm giving gifts, and I've gotten three candles in a row for my birthday once, so it's kind of necessary for candles, and I guess I didn't really understand this idea, so I guess this candles are also a little bit of a no-good gift, and these candles don't grow very well, or they're only used when you're alone, so I think they're a little bit limited because they're not universally versatile.\ncaller: When I was in elementary school, my parents bought me a watch for Christmas, and they didn't really buy me a present for Children's Day or Christmas, but they gave me a watch because they thought it was a good time management gift, so I still have that watch, and I don't see any of the other watches, and I haven't seen any of the others, and I think it's the most memorable gift I've ever received, and the fact that it's a watch is a gift that means something when you give it to me, and it costs a little bit more, and it's one of the rarest gifts you've gotten.\nreceiver: Yeah, I remember when I was in high school, a friend of mine used that kind of thick paper and put it in the shape of a fridge and made it into a cookie, which was a very common way to give a birthday present in those days, and I thought it was really cool, and it was really weird, so I tried to give it to my other friends later, but I guess it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, so I was really happy when I got that fridge and that birthday present.\ncaller: I think letters are used when they're really important or when you need to say something, but otherwise it's not very well-written, and I think it's easier to just send a message.\nreceiver: No, I've never given a gift for the amount, but I think it would be fun if we had the opportunity to do that, but now that the price is going up, I'm thinking about whether we can give a gift for 10,000 yuan, and this may be different in many ways, but my personal opinion is that it's difficult to give a gift with 10,000 yuan, so if you could give a gift up to 50,000 yuan, what kind of gift would you like to give?\ncaller: If I say $50,000, I'll give you anything, but sometimes I think the best gift is something like a voucher that someone else has gotten, and sometimes I think it's the best gift that I've gotten. $50,000 is not a small amount, it's not that much, it seems a little vague to give something, but $50,000 is a small coffee maker, or maybe it's an electrical appliance.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Well, we're going to take your credit card and the credit intermediary's credit card and use the credit agency's billing records for the customers that we've enrolled, and we'll talk to them, and we will talk to your agent, and then we'll do the check-in for the part that you're supposed to receive, and if that part is authenticated, then you'll be able to verify it in the transaction, but this is the part you can verify right now, but not the part in the timeline that you can check right now.\nreceiver: Well, I know this is because I'm running late, but is there any way that I can confirm that?\ncaller: Not at this hour.\nreceiver: I mean...\ncaller: If you'd be so kind as to say so, I'd like to tell you that we've received the newsletter itself from Rush and Cash, and that we'll process the return, and we'll pay the monthly interest, the transaction fees, the administration code fees, and then we'll send it back to you.\nreceiver: I'm sorry if I'm late for work, but can I get a fax or something?\ncaller: The fax -- it's the part that you have to give to the customer anyway, but it's not the part that we're able to fax these parts out. We're not out of funds, we're out of money. If we do this by mistake, because it's government funding, we'll be contacted by government support, and then I'll just have to deal with the disciplinary process, and in the case of the part that I'm giving to the customer once, you'll have to check it tomorrow, and if I can give it to the customer, I'll check it, but I'll tell you one more thing.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you're in doubt about whether it's $70,000 or $5,000,000,\nreceiver: It's five million.\ncaller: No, I think it's more than that.\nreceiver: No, it's five million dollars, because I checked with Rush and Cash, and that's the end of it, and I know that if, for example, the old 18 million dollars were to fall through the cracks in the middle, I would now be a credit card borrower with someone else's consent.\ncaller: But I'll tell you what.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: What are you talking about?\nreceiver: No, I'm sorry I doubted you.\ncaller: No, no, you can do that for your customers.\nreceiver: My father's mother was arrested for something.\ncaller: Oh, I know that's not part of it.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: I'm going to tell you as much as I can about the part where I can reassure you, because I can't -- if we can show you anything at the moment, I can definitely show you -- there's nothing wrong with that, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it, and I -- and I would like to fax all of this to your customers until we get to the middle of the payment, but there's no part that I can do. Instead, what I can assure you is that there is no reason for the seventy-eight departments to be bored, because that's why we take the rush and the cash, and we process it, and the customer processes the refund.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So you've all been verified, and there's no way that you can verify that if you're a scammer on our side, and we're going to give you an example of how to do it, and you'll see that you can do it right away. Well, we're saying thank you to your customer, but you're calling the company personally as much as you can, and then you're saying the wrong thing, and they're taking your customer away from you, so that you can make it as convenient as possible for them, and then we'll get an electronic invoice and we'll verify what we've done, and then they'll pay it back to the account that you've transferred to Rush and Cash, right?\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: We've done all of this with the help of the government, and if you've got your Rush &amp; Cash checked out, you wouldn't have been able to do it without our help, right? You know, because we've paid for the monthly fees, the billing codes, and we've covered all of the transaction costs, right? Well, you can't do your Rush and Cash checks out without our help.\nThe client?\nreceiver: Oh, you didn't.\ncaller: That's right. And then you know, of course, there are interim repayment fees and things like that, if you take out a loan.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: Okay, you paid for that, didn't you? We paid for it, and you clearly said that Rush and Cash were cleaned up? You said you checked out, client.\nreceiver: No, I mean, it's after seven o'clock.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\nreceiver: And I called you right away, and you didn't call me back, and I called you back, and you never called me back, so from my point of view, I could only think that it was a moment of shock.\ncaller: So you're right, I'm going to tell you how to make a call, and I'll tell you about the part where I was suddenly notified and I suddenly went down to the payment department, and then I couldn't tell the person in charge of the telecommunications to give me the call that I called about the transmission, and I went down and I didn't know what to do and I came up now.\nreceiver: Okay, first of all, yes.\ncaller: You see, Rush and Cassie were only talking about five million won for your bond proceeds. Well, this is the part that we've dealt with, so you're dealing with it. You've checked this part, right?\nreceiver: I was wondering if I could, uh, check with the goddess, the goddess of finance, the name of the counselor?\ncaller: Well, you can check it tomorrow.\nreceiver: Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.\ncaller: Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. It's in the morning.\nreceiver: Yes, of course.\ncaller: I'll get back to you as soon as I can, and I'll let you know how it goes, sir.\nreceiver: Oh, I see.\ncaller: But think about it, if you're a Rush &amp; Cathy customer, the reason you don't suspect this part is because you've verified that you did it yourself, but then again, how did Rush and Cathy get into my account this year, and yes, I just got in today?\ncaller: Yes, you've processed the refund, but then again, even if you get the refund processed, and then you process the refund and then you cancel, there's a transaction fee, a payment management code, a monthly interest fee, and there's also a refund fee.\nreceiver: I know.\ncaller: If you don't, you can't, because you haven't taken out a loan twice, and you know what happens when you take out a loan?\nreceiver: Oh, I wish there was something I could trust around here today.\ncaller: I can't help it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Now, if you think about it, if you're a customer, you can think about it in a simple way, because you've been worried about something like this since seven o'clock, and now you've had a little bit of an accident, and you're worried about it, but if you just think about it simply, you'll get the answer. If you want to repair Rush &amp; Cash, of course, if you make a deal, we'll put extra on the rest of the parts, whether you repaired that part, or we did that repair on that part, and we repaired it instead.\nreceiver: Yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.\ncaller: Don't worry about it.\nreceiver: Then call me tomorrow.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: I know.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Can I help you?\ncaller: Hello, I'm a student using the Happiness Bank, and I'm currently using my dad's issued Junior Credit Card, and I know that I can now get my own cheque card issued by myself, so is that possible?\nreceiver: Please state your name and date of birth.\ncaller: My name is Park Ji-yeon, and I was born on October 12, 2002.\ncaller: This is the HP Junior Star Fund savings account.\nreceiver: It's your client.\ncaller: But when I got the ticket, I was 14 years old, and when I went to get the ticket reissued, or the cash-only reissue card, I had to go with my dad, because it was so uncomfortable.\nreceiver: Do you have a current residence card?\ncaller: I've got a residence card in my name and a family identification card that I received a week ago.\nreceiver: For your customers, if you are over 18 years old, you can only have a check card if you have a certificate of residence and proof of family ties.\ncaller: Okay, but I'm an adult now, and I know that the order I'm writing seems to be a child's order, so there's a lot of limitations on how I can write it.\nreceiver: You can bring your residency card and proof of family ties.\ncaller: And I looked at the Happiness Bank website, and it's now called the Cultural Clearinghouse, and I looked at a check card for young people, and I saw the details, and I heard that if you add a prepaid transportation card system, you can get a 0.5% discount, and you can get discounts at many national cultural centers.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: But is this for everyone? Other places seem to use more than 100,000 yuan per month.\ncaller: So you have to apply for a postpaid transportation card instead of a prepaid one, so you get a discount.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: There's no discount for members who use prepaid transportation cards, because they're minors and students, and they know they can't use credit cards, and they only use prepaid.\nreceiver: Prepaid transportation cards are supposed to be rechargeable, so there's no discount.\ncaller: Well, apart from the transportation card, there's a discount on admission to the National Cultural Center and places like Lotteworld and Everland.\nreceiver: Discounts for state-designated cultural centers apply to everyone, but Lotteworld only applies to those who use more than 300,000 yuan per month.\ncaller: So I don't think I'm going to be able to get a really good discount if I use it, so I'm just going to have to get a check card out of the ATM, because I'd like to get a card out that gives me this kind of discount.\nreceiver: Let me check it out.\ncaller: Yes, I see.\nreceiver: I have an HPB check card, sir.\ncaller: Oh, I think I saw on the website that there's a discount on admission to the national cultural center, and I know that when I use my check card, 0.3 percent of that amount goes into my account, right?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Does that mean I get the full discount if I don't use more than a certain amount each month?\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: So it's not like a check card, you can just go to the website and apply for it.\nreceiver: It's available on your website and you can download the app.\ncaller: I downloaded the app the other day and tried to sign up, but they said I needed a valid ID, and I don't have a valid ID yet.\ncaller: I'm not using an iPhone, I'm using an Android, and I know that Android doesn't have an app, so you have to go to the website of the accredited certificate and apply for it, and then you can sign up.\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: When you get a valid ID, you can sign up and then apply for a card.\nreceiver: Once you've done that, you'll need to go through the process of verifying your citizenship.\ncaller: But, you said earlier that you need a certificate of registration and a certificate of family relationship to issue a check card, but it's impossible to verify this because you don't do it face-to-face with the app, so how do you do this?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right, the process of taking a photo of your citizenship card, and if you take it, it's automatically certified.\ncaller: Okay, I'm going to have to go through the process, and if I apply, how long does it take, I know it's usually a week, but I have to start playing next week, and if there's a lot of delays, I might be able to get it later.\ncaller: Is there any way that I can receive this?\nreceiver: Can you give me your address, please?\ncaller: This is the 11th floor of Corrigan's Apartment 301 East 111 in Maputo, South Korea.\nreceiver: The closest point is the endpoint A and the endpoint B, and you can receive it directly.\ncaller: If I could go from point A to point B and get a receipt, it wouldn't take me a week, because point A and point B are actually a little bit far from my house.\nreceiver: It'll only take you four days, sir.\ncaller: Well, if you'll do that, I wonder if I could apply for a personal visit.\nreceiver: Yes, I'll do that.

because it was the longest, and it was the last, and then I met someone I knew there, and I went to see the house, and I ate there, and it wasn't as good as I thought it would be, and it's okay, and the dessert was completely different from our country, and it came out like it was baked in a bakery, so that's what I remember most, and then, uh, you're the most memorable thing I've eaten there.\ncaller: Well, I've eaten pasta there, and I've probably eaten all sorts of similar things, and other things, and I feel bad when I try something new and it fails a little bit, and I keep eating the same thing, and she keeps eating something a little bit different, so it's fun to take a little bit at a time, and that's all I can think about.\nreceiver: Well, I was in Florence in that Rome, and that's why the statue was so big, and we went there at one in the morning, and we had this, what's-his-name, this fountain, and people were just throwing coins, and on the day that we went, we had a day of cleaning the coins and we saw people being cleaned in front of it, and so we poured all the money into it, and it was a lot of money, and so I was excited, and then I went in a little thin clothes, and I was so cold that morning, and I went to the store next to us and I was shivering from eating hot chocolate, so that's what I remember most, and then you went to the restaurant there, and we ate it in Carbondale, Korea, and we also ate it there.\ncaller: I guess our country is a little bit better, but I don't really like carbonado, so I like to eat a little bit of sweet food here, and even though it's the sweetest there, it's not really bitter, you just have to taste it, so there's a lot of real food that tastes good, and there's also a lot of things that don't taste good, so it was a little bit, and then we took a lot of trains there.\nreceiver: We don't sleep on the train all the time, but every time we move from one place to another, we get on the train, and it looks like there's a window in the seat, and it's winter, and the snow has just fallen, and every time we change places, the scenery changes, and I think it's amazing, and the seat looks different from our country, and the most memorable thing is that I stole my bag when I was crossing in France, and that's what I remember most, but it was fun to see the traffic, and I also felt that other countries have less traffic than our country, so it's good that the subway stations are very dark, they don't block the Internet, and they're very narrow, so I mean, the culture and buildings of those countries are intact, but it's nice that they're intact, because it looks so different, and then it's a little uncomfortable, so you're coming out there and seeing something new and cultural and artistic, and that was the best thing I've ever seen.\ncaller: Well, to be honest, at first it was all exciting, but I'm a little tired of seeing the same thing over and over again, and I think I'd like to stop seeing it, and the last time I was there, I went up on the roof, and I saw the whole city, and when I went there, it was really beautiful, and it was a little bit of a climb, and I wanted to go and see it, but I just went because it was so beautiful and it was good, and then I went to the museum, the Louvre Museum, and I always looked at it in my books, and I was a little excited, and I went there and I saw artwork that I knew, and that's good, but it was kind of fun, except it was a bit boring.\nreceiver: When I looked at the monastery, because I thought there would be a lot of people in front of it, and I didn't get a good shot, and I don't think I got a good look at it, because there was a barrier, and there were a lot of other people in the fall, and I think that's how most famous works of art are done at that time, so it was a little bit lacking, but even if it was a piece of art like this, it was only the Colosseum or whatever, the cathedral, the top or whatever, but it was still a building, so you could see it from pretty close, and it was really cool to see it in a photo, and then you could walk around all day and see it, and then it was just amazing at first, but then it just felt like it was built like a rock, so I kept looking, and I had no idea, and then I just went, and then there's a little bit of a gap somewhere.\ncaller: It was a little bit physically challenging at first, and, to be honest, at first, it was hard to adjust to that time, and I was worried about it, and, uh, it wasn't that different, but then I was so tired, and it was kind of like that, and I just kept going around and around and around, and I guess it was a bit of a struggle, because it was a lot of work, but there were a lot of fun things to see when I went there, a lot of things to see for the first time, and it felt a little bit different.\nreceiver: The gelato.\ncaller: Gelato, that's too memorable. How about you?\nreceiver: What was the best thing you ate there?\ncaller: I'm going to be honest, I didn't expect it to taste good because it's made with rice, but I ate it, and it tastes so much better than I thought it would, and I'm a pistachio person, and I like chocolate, so I thought I'd like to eat it with something, and I ate it again, and it tasted so good, and I went there, and I saw horses and stuff, and what was that like?\nreceiver: I remembered it was a white boy, but sometimes in our country, when you go to a cultural experience like this, it's just like that. It's just the whole province or if you go to such a place, if you have a traditional experience like that, you say so. It is also real, but I thought I would see it, but I didn't expect it, and I was surprised, because I hadn't eaten much gelato in Korea, but when I ate it, it was just ice cream, and it was a little bit more confusing, and I felt like this, so I ate it in a famous place, oh, I think I know why it's famous, and honestly, I didn 't expect much in the food, the desserts were delicious, so I went to that bakery, but it wasn't anything special, it was delicious, and then I remembered that you were the only one of us who went back to where I wanted to go\ncaller: And then I want to go back to the house that I went to with him, where they did so well, and the food was so delicious, and I guess there's something else going on, and I don't know what it is, but it's a little bit different, and I'd like to go back because you're the ones who made me remember it a little bit, and maybe I do, and then she said, \"Well, that's the first time we've ever been out of the country together, and besides, I haven't seen that amount of money very often, so I'm a little confused, and honestly, I can't remember all of it, so when I do the math, I'm like, oh, this isn't a lot, and she was like,\nreceiver: I've always tried to look up the exchange rate on my phone every time I go to the store, but at first I don't know, and then after a couple of days, I'll know what a few dollars is, so the best part was that now Switzerland is really expensive than anywhere else, and I knew it was expensive, and the scenery was really beautiful, and if you were going to buy stuff like that, you had to pay twice as much somewhere else, and it was a little cheap, but it wasn't where we lived, it was where we collected money and went to play for a while, so we spend money, so we don't realize how much we spent it, and we just keep using it as long as we have money.\ncaller: First of all, Japan is the closest and I've seen a lot of people, so I can hear it, but people say that Japan is more fun than I think, and I want to see the hot springs there because I want to go there.\nreceiver: I don't really want to go to Japan because there's just so many people who've been around, and I feel like I've been there indirectly, and I've just been there every day, and I just bought some jelly, and I bought some food, and I didn't feel very safe, and I thought if I could go, I'd have to say, \"Where is it?\"\ncaller: I don't know much about Germany, to be honest, but I guess I'm just a little bit drawn to it, but the last time someone said they wanted to go to Germany, I think I did some research on Germany at the time, and I saw that TV show on a professional program, and I thought it would be nice to see a lot of it, and I want to see it, and we're going to have some kind of traffic problems, and we don't have enough money, we're a little bit unprepared, so we've gone, and then I want to prepare in a really good way, and send a little bit of good luck.\nreceiver: You're asking me questions, because first of all, we've taken you where you want to go, and then we've decided as a family where we want to go.

So, in North Korea, the upper classes are now getting paid to eat, and they're eating well, and the lower classes are dying from hunger and disease, and there's still a lot of talk about rice. There's a lot of discussion about whether to give rice, why to give it, and so on, and so forth.\ncaller: I also think it's right not to get it, because I can tell you that it's more important for the people of your own country, and in fact, there's an article that says that the crime rate is very high among the refugees who have now come to Korea by sea from war-torn countries, and I remember reading that article, and of course we support refugees, but I don't think that helping refugees is necessarily the only way to bring them home, but rather than bringing them home and donating to other countries for refugees, we should be supporting other countries in a variety of ways, such as donating to refugees who are living in other countries. And I would like to ask you about whether we need to strengthen our cultural heritage, and I'm opposed to that, and I think that if we don't strengthen one culture, we have a greater chance of development, because I think that this is the same thing as the genocide in the Korean peninsula, but I think that we need to look at it more because I think we need to take into account not only the cultural heritage but also the social and economic heritage of the country.\nreceiver: I think we need to strengthen our cultural structure, for example, when I see the idol singers, there's a group of young people called Vicious, who go abroad and promote our country by doing so, and that's how our country is known, but of course, now we export a lot of things about Korea, such as fish items or dramas, clothing, shoes, etc. I think it's good to strengthen the cultural structure by sticking to one culture, but it's also very good to embrace another culture, so that we can grow, and in this way, it's easier to accept the culture of another country now, so that when we meet later, it will be easier to understand each other and talk to each other, and I hope that it will be a good example. I'm still surprised that if I go somewhere else, I'm surprised that if you go somewhere in the southeast of Korea, there is a very famous family like this one, and if you go to Bangkok, you don't even like Korean enough to say that you're a Korean, or that you belong to the Korean army, so I think it would be nice to have a simple\ncaller: And I think that the idea that there can be different cultures within a family, and I think that it's possible, because of course, families are one big community, but within that community, I think that each of the members, individually, have their own individuality, and I don't think that's a bad thing, I think it's quite a natural phenomenon, and we have to respect that.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Think about the monthly rent. Not long ago, they said the rent was less than one million won. These days, they say it's more than 10 million won. Here, the tenant originally said it was only 2.97 million won, but they said it's up to 12 million won. That doesn't sound too much.\nreceiver: I've never heard of it being amended, but I think it should be amended. I've been told that this is the second year that the Amendment to the Rent-A-Car Protection Act is pending in parliament in our country, and it's not pending, but it should be quickly amended so that the rent-a-car owner can win against the tenant and the tenant can win against each other, and there should be an amendment to the law that guarantees both legal protection and social protection. I'm thinking, as you can see from this article, that the tenant actually risked his life by protesting that he wouldn't steal the store, and he couldn't do it, so he put an unemployment watch on the tenant to hammer him with a mallet.\ncaller: So this is something that we're trying to change in the law, and I'm wondering if there's a law that's going to be passed that will satisfy both the tenant who owns the building and the tenant of the big car dealerships. The tenant, of course, wants to have a long-term lease, and he's right about that, but it's not that the tenant can't take into account the fact that he owns his own building, and he has a lot of financial income from that building, so he's a tenant, and there are a lot of times when he doesn't get the rent that he's supposed to get because of the lease term, and it's also going to break up with that person, and I think it's gonna be hard to develop a law that satisfies both of them, but I think some kind of law that would have to be debated in the House of Representatives very quickly, especially when it comes to sales.\nreceiver: Of course, we have to protect business and property rights, but I haven't really thought about it, so I don't have a lot of ideas.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

How do you think about this\nreceiver: I think the problem of low birth rate is probably due to economic factors, because women have to work, they have to earn money, and they have to live, so I think it's a time when women are busy feeding themselves, and I think there's a situation where more and more women are not having babies, and if you give more benefits to women, I think that low birth rate will be solved to some extent.\ncaller: I'm very positive that the conscription period will be extended to three years and two years, which means that those who want to be soldiers can support more and can become soldiers, and on the contrary, those who have to work for three years as conscripts, even if they don't want to be a soldier, sacrifice for the country and reduce the time of sacrifice, because they go out to society quickly and contribute to other economic forces, and I think this reduction is very positive, even though we have reduced the length of service in our country from 21 months to 18 months.\nreceiver: I don't know about the military, but there's a lot more benefits, and if there's more you can give, I think you should give as much as you can, so that you can afford those benefits.\ncaller: I don't think it's going to help anyone who doesn't want to go.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

My house is quite large, so I have a few friends who live with us in our house, and I can't help them much, but one or two of them live with me, and I personally try very hard to create good memories and happy laughs for refugees who have a lot of fear of people, but their faces are always dark, and their hearts are always closed. So instead of my own efforts to open their hearts, I have a positive attitude towards refugees, whether they are residents of the empire or residents of our country, the people of the Republic of Korea, and all the people in the world. My brother is my friend, and I think that working together to help each other is the most important thing for the development of the future, so I think that refugees are our friends in this era of globalization, and I don't think that there will be any more refugees like us, but I think that there may be a natural increase in the number of\ncaller: There's no way to reduce it, because it's coming in groups, and I don't think it's possible for the majority of people to come in one-by-one like this.\nreceiver: Now, I've heard that a lot of North Koreans are coming into our country through China, and I'm thinking that the North Koreans, in some ways, are part of the refugee community, and I think that they're also part of our community, and we have to spend a lot of time with them, because we're going to help them a lot and go out with them, and I personally think that in the future, when our country is united, we'd like to prevent that kind of thing from happening, and North Koreans going to other countries, because North Korea is one of our countries, and there's a lot of fiction books about refugees being published, and when you read those books, how do you feel?\ncaller: I haven't read the book yet, but I think there's a lot of talk about refugees these days, that refugees are more attracted to people who have the same boundaries as immigrants, and I have to experience it, and I think it's bound to be uncomfortable, and it's something that I feel when I travel a lot these days, and sometimes I'm a little confused as to whether they're refugees or foreigners. And I think that it's better to think of them as the same people, rather than you and I as refugees and I as foreigners, but rather, I think that if they don't do bad things, and they just live in the same neighborhood, we can live together in a better light. What do you think? It's scary to have a refugee living next door, and you want to be friends.\nreceiver: I'm currently living with three refugees in Jeju City, so there's no fear or worry or fear about refugees, and I've never felt uncomfortable while I've been with them, and there's never been a moment when I've felt awkward at first meeting people from our own country, which is something that everyone has, and of course, I think we need time to get to know each other, and I want to create a time when we can be more together with the refugees, when we have the opportunity, and I don't want to be able to solve this refugee problem on my own, but I want to go beyond that and see if there's a way that I can help a little bit more specifically, whether it's through the country or the government.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Now I think that there are 65 million people in our country, and the solution is focused only on reducing the cost of medical care, but if this does not alleviate any costs, it may not play a small role, but the ultimate solution is also to reduce the cost of living, and I think that it is better to be aware of the fact that it is a bit more cost-effective than that, and I have heard the last time that it hurts my heart to think about it.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

So what do you think about summer?\nreceiver: Summer is a wonderful time of the year, you can enjoy your favorite sports, and in the summer, you can go camping with your family, and you can go skiing, and one of the things that comes to mind in the summer is skiing, skiing with the family, and why do people want to go skiing in the spring, summer, autumn, winter, in the summer with their family, and maybe that's because summer is the best season, and I'm thinking, how do I plan to spend my summer skiing with my family?\ncaller: I'd like to send a petition, but these days, because of the coronavirus, I think I'm just going to have to go home and get water and send my petition. It's really sad, this kind of weather, in this kind of summer weather, it's so cold, you can go camping outside and play in the water, and now when you go out in the valley, it gets so cold, and this is the season, and this kind of thing is happening, and it's really hard to go out, and the summer is very nice, but I think it's going to be fun, so I went to the valley a little while ago, because it was nearby in the summer, and I was a kid, and I thought a lot, well, maybe I could show the kids something like that, and I'd catch some fish, and I think the summer season is really good, and if you think about it, I think every season has one or two more years of age, but it's also a good time to remember the past, and it feels good to go through the season.\nreceiver: When it rains, I always think of the straw in my hair. Since I was in school, of course, but when I was in college, it always rains today. I used to go to this place. We all go to the straw house, don't we?\ncaller: When it rains, when I was a kid, it rained, and I'd just run around with my flowers, but now that I'm an adult, I hate it raining, and I don't like to be rained on, and I think about how much work there is when it rains. I have to do a lot of cleaning, a lot of laundry, the car gets dirty, and I carry it around a lot, and then I think I lose a lot of that childhood feeling.\nreceiver: I think everyone can relate to the fact that cleaning, stacking laundry, and stuff like that, which usually makes our lives miserable, or raining, which usually doubles it. For housewives, the weather has a lot to do with the size of the family, and when it does, you want to go out and have a cup of tea, and you want to be in the mood, and you feel like a chimney, but it's not true. What do you generally do on a good day? I mean, it's a hot summer these days, and it's cooler than going out and having a cup of coffee with your friends. It's hot and raining these days, but I don't know if it's okay to go out for a cup of water with your friends, because it's raining today, and there's a lot of work to be done, and I think I'm going to have to call my friends and meet them for a cup.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Your name is being stolen, you're involved in a financial crime involving a major distribution center, but that's the part that we need to verify because we've just made a phone call. One Bank and now the Bank of Agriculture have been used as a distribution center. Let me tell you a little bit about it. Do you know your name is Kim Hyun Woo?\nreceiver: No, I don't know.\ncaller: Because this time we've been searching for a financial crime ring led by Kim Hyun-woo, and in the process of searching, we've seized a large number of credit cards, security cards, and firearms receipts. In the process of seizing these two receipts, one bank receipt, which I mentioned earlier, is in the name of Mr. Jin-ho, and the Agricultural Bank receipt, has been found. Do you have any information about whether or not this receipt was opened?\nreceiver: No, I'm not using both.\ncaller: The opening date is February 11th, 2015, and the competition was also opened in Phnom Penh's Iron Mountain District.\nreceiver: It's rough.\ncaller: You've never been here before, have you?\nreceiver: No, I've never been that way.\ncaller: So you don't have any part of it where you're getting monetary compensation or you're selling or whatever?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: So, in the last three years, have you ever lost or had anything stolen -- a cell phone, a wallet, an I.D., a driver's license, anything that could leak your personal information?\nreceiver: There's no such thing.\ncaller: There's no such thing. First of all, we have a leak detector, which is the part that we're investigating and working on right now, whether it's the Internet, or the part that could be leaked, or 68 people outside of Kim Jong Un's party, who were formerly in the financial sector, who are still investigating something like a leak inspector. The part we're figuring out right now is that there's about two hundred people who are involved in this case right now, who have been involved in the case right now. There's about seventy to a hundred of them, some of them are being sold for monetary value, and they're like people who don't know anything about foreign sentiment, so they have no idea how the system was set up and how it's been used. We're sorting those people out, and there's a lot of people out there who are now receiving calls saying that they're not victims.\nNow, the account that was created in his name, the account of the Han Bank and the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which I mentioned earlier, has brought about about 300 million won of money back and forth, from where now the people who saw the damage have filed a complaint against him because he is the owner of the account.\nreceiver: I haven't been contacted personally.\ncaller: That's why we're contacting you separately right now.\nreceiver: Then where can I get in touch with you?\ncaller: Can I have the case number now, please?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Are you at home or are you working?\nreceiver: This is home.\ncaller: I'd like a note at home now.\nreceiver: Isn't that what's going on these days?\ncaller: If it's voice-spying, you're asking me for money, what am I doing, doing this useless thing?\nreceiver: So where do I call it?

Whether you wanted to do this or not, in the illegal field, you've either opened it yourself, or you've suffered a personal injury, because there was a message in Mr. Kim's name.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: In the process of tracing the accounts, we're going to see if there are any financial transactions with Kim Jong-un's factions.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, can I get a call from the D.A. in a little bit?\ncaller: Yes, you can call the prosecutor directly. I'm Detective Yoon Han-suk. I'll be the detective. If you don't have any financial transactions, you can take a look at the victim's records.\nreceiver: I did.\ncaller: Now you're concerned that other banks might be found besides Hanko Bank and SAIC Bank, and we're trying to prevent secondary damage, so if you find any other bank accounts besides the ones you created, we'll have them frozen, okay?\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: And I understand that, because you're not hanging up the phone, and you can talk about it after you've listened to the rest of what I'm saying.\nI'm going to ask you to listen to the rest of this.\nreceiver: You can't call me back in a little while.\ncaller: And if we do, we're going to issue a subpoena, and you're gonna have to show up at our office within the next week to be subpoenaed for questioning.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: Mr. Jin, the address of your house is 63-18 106th Street, right?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, we're gonna send you a subpoena, so if you'd like to come down to the precinct next week and get your subpoena.\nreceiver: How long does a subpoena take?\ncaller: We're going to send you a summons by elevator, and you'll arrive this week, and if you hurry, you'll be in there tomorrow morning, and by next week, you have to get your summons checked before next Monday, or you'll have a lot of disadvantages if you don't get a summons.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: I know.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Why is it that there are regular jobs out there, and the candidates say that's not fair, and they have a lot of places to go, and they're going to fail the exams, and then they've got a lot of room to go in, and then the informal jobs, do you have to be an informal job for the rest of your life, and you have to have that opportunity, and the salaries aren't the same as the regular jobs, and then after retirement, it's going to be a little bit of a rhetoric about whether or not to regularize the regular jobs and have people who are eligible to vote, so if you've ever thought about this issue, have you thought about it?\nreceiver: I didn't really know much about it, but those people who were in the informal sector are now transitioning into the regular sector, and I think that people who were originally preparing for the job now think that it's unfair that there are fewer regular jobs, and frankly, it's not like they've been working their whole lives in informal jobs to get into informal jobs, and they've all been working very hard to transition to the regular sector. And I think it makes no sense to me personally, and it's different between the job preparation sector and the non-formal sector, because the job training sector hasn't even become informal, and if you think that the formalization is unfair, then I think you're more likely to try to get people to go into informal sectors to become full-time jobs, but there's a lot of conflict between informal and regular sectors, so what do you think?\ncaller: Yes, I think conflict is about salary, money, money, I don't think there are regular jobs and non-regular jobs, for example, non-regular jobs have higher salaries. If you write, no one is going to do a regular job, all of them are irregular, but yes, that's the conflict about that, we have to be patient with each other, we have got to know each other, and the opportunities are there for each other, so you have to be prepared. You have to be ready for that, why do you think it's not fair, when I see this incident, you say, \"My cousin bought the land, and I'm sick of it\". If it happens suddenly, then how do we do it? Well, as I just said, if you can't get into a regular regular job, you have to go into a non-regular job, and people who have the ability to enter a regular job don't care about that. You don't have to clean up all kinds of regular jobs, or sit around and wait for the librarian, but if you listen to people like that, they're going to go to a private job\nreceiver: And I'm thinking about these job seekers who are angry about the fact that these informal jobs have been formalized, and they've just posted it on the Internet, and I've just been doing this kind of polling, and at this point in time, I'm wondering if they could have made more of an effort to get into informal jobs and work, or if they couldn't have become a regular job like those people, and they haven't gotten a job as a job seeker yet, because they're lacking a little bit of their own effort, and they didn't get a job because the company legalized the informal jobs, and that's why I didn't have a job.\ncaller: It's a sandwich, our country's position is to sit still, and even in those hours of sleep, we are pressured by the four great powers, and the relationship between North and South is very important, but there is no problem that can be solved between the two of us, because there is a United Nations agreement, there is a ceasefire agreement, so it's up to Moon Jae-in, whether it's a conservative government or a progressive government or any government, if he listens to all the relationships, he will try to make them all good, and every time they play the game of the great powers, it will be something that we can't achieve.\nreceiver: I was just thinking about that last year when I saw the North-South summit and the handshakes, and I thought, oh, this day is coming, maybe there will be a real unification, and then after that, I'm just a little bit nervous and I'm a little bit scared, so I think that unification is going to be difficult, and on the other hand, I think it's going to happen again, and I always think that you have to do unification since I was a kid, and I've learned this, but I didn't understand it well when I was a little bit younger, and I still don't have a good relationship with North Korea, and I have to make peace with it, and I had a little bit of that thought, and I think it might be right to do unify, and I also think that it's a little bit weird because of the economic development, and I don't think there's a unification right now, and it's not our country, North Korea, but there's some attention because of the other stiff countries around it, and that's what my teacher said, that South Korea and North Korea\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

I get it. But if you spend it on retirement, you'll get a 30 percent reduction in your retirement income tax?\ncaller: It's your client.\nreceiver: Now, what I'm hearing is that if, for example, you have a retirement fund of $100,000,000 and your tax liability is $10 million, then you take $100,000,000, put it in, and then when you get your pension, you subtract $30,000,000 out of it?\nreceiver: It's a kind of inductive dimension, where you don't spend your money all at once, you spend it in retirement.\ncaller: Yes, that's right.\nreceiver: So I'm going to put it in a retirement savings account, and if the company doesn't want it later, you can contact the financial institution, and that's fine.\ncaller: Yeah, is that how we're gonna do this?\nreceiver: No, I just wanted to have a consultation today, and I'm glad I did, because I didn't know what it was, but now I know everything, and I know what the right system is for me.\ncaller: Yes, thank you.

I would like to ask you a question about whether it is right for art agents to receive military service privileges if Sim Seok-hee, Kim Ye-jin, Im-me Jia-bin were men.\nreceiver: I think it's fair to say that these people are deserving of military privilege because they have shone a light on the country, but I think it is right to say that if you can get military privilege for something like this, you should get it, but if you do basic military training for a short period of time, maybe a few months, and then you work and shine a light on your country and give back to your country with something else, then I think you should be entitled to military privilege. Oh, and oh, in this article, at the beginning of the race, Mr. Reuben said that he was in a crisis of losing focus and falling to the bottom, and then he continued to chase and left the wheel open, and Korea came in third, and then from the remaining nine laps, he went up to second, and then straight up to first. I wondered what kind of great feeling I felt when I saw this, how much performance we had against Korea on our soundtrack.\ncaller: I think there was a lot of frustration at the beginning and then frustration afterwards, but I was very proud to see our Korean athletes who overcame that frustration and eventually got to be number one. Well, I think these athletes should be treated well enough, but what do you think about discrimination against current athletes in the Korean Athletic Association?\nreceiver: But I don't know if there is such a thing, and I don' t know if it exists, but it' s just a little bit, and unless I hear something and see it with my own eyes, I think it' s part of something that I didn' t believe in, and I' m worried and I might be worried when I crossed the finish line like you said, but even in that situation, I was trying harder and I was trying to get to the finish line, so I couldn' t make it to the top, because I went to the short track race, and I was like, well, for example, in that one case, the person who was doing the fencing was in a situation where the score difference was so huge that he was so far away, and I did the brainstorming on my own, and I said that I could do it on TV, and now it' s coming out of TV, and I am so angry, and when I see these guys, I feel like, what can I do now, because I' m young, and I fell down, but I' m not a jerk, and I wonder if we could do this because we' ve won the\ncaller: If I were in this situation, if I was in this situation where I'm going to be a runner-up because of my mistake, I think I would be very frustrated, I think it would take me a long time to get up from that frustration, and I don't think it would be that hard to get up and be at the top of the podium as quickly as a short track, and you said before that it's rare to discriminate against players, and there's been a problem of bullying between players in the game, and I'm not sure if it was a collaborative short track, but there's never been a problem with bullying among players in any international game, so I'm wondering what you think about this and what the solution is.\nreceiver: So the problem of bullying is that it's kind of embarrassing, but it's because of the camera shots on the TV that these people are unfriendly or they're being bullied, because everybody knows that now, but somehow it could be embarrassing or it could be real, but if there is a solution, it's that they've been actively bullied because they have feelings for each other, because someone hates this friend and there are a lot of people who hate this friend, and then they see that they have to sort out the relationship between them, and in order to do that, they have to be actively engaged in some kind of movement or something, and the director of the team sees that you have to do that by talking actively, and if you don't have that kind of emotion, if you just don't like bullying in that way, you're going to be very aggressive or psychologically damaged, because there's a lot of things that are being bullied by the king, you'll be banned from playing games, you won't be kicked out of school, and you're not going to be kicked\ncaller: And I think there should be enough deprivation, because it's a problem like school violence or bullying, and it really does leave a wound in the victim that can't be washed away, and I understand how much it hurts, because I've also been subjected to similar types of harassment, and so I think there needs to be enough people who are deprived, whether it's deprivation or punishments, even punishments that somehow feel severe.\nreceiver: I'm very happy to be in the same country as you, and I think it's great that you have such a talented team.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

What did you say?\ncaller: Thirty-five thousand four thousand five hundred and twenty square\nreceiver: It's been a few months.\ncaller: Sixty months, five years.\nreceiver: 80 months, five years, 17 million won.\ncaller: Yes, 17 million won.\nreceiver: What's the interest?\ncaller: It's going to be 9.8.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But now your client's home inspection has resulted in conditional approval.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: What this conditional approval means is that your client is now unsuitable for his age, as he initially received 24 million yen from Hyundai Capital.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But now you've got about eight million dollars left, and this is the part of your credit score that you got when you first got it.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But we're not getting much credit for that right now, so we're a little bit underqualified with the data right now.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But this condition, if you're going to loosen it up a little bit, and if you want to take our money today, there's only one way to do it, and that's by using Modern Capital.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: You've got to make a few exceptions to that, and if you make some exceptions, it's obviously going to show that we're out of money right now, so even the remittance team that's making the remittances is a little short of that right now, and I'd like to ask you, the client, to see if there are any exceptions where you're using Modern Capital right now, which is why I'm calling you right now.\nreceiver: How much do you have to change?\ncaller: How much do you think you can do?\nreceiver: No, I mean, no, it's 9.8%, but if you're going to do it on these terms, I'm going to have to back it up.\ncaller: So you can do this for the rest of the money, all of it?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So if you're willing to do whatever it takes, we can fund you up to $20 million.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: That's 9.8 pro, if you can get to 9.2 pro.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: But now that you've got the funds, the remaining $8 million, can you change all of this right now?\nreceiver: No, I mean, for example, this is what I'm conditioned to do, pay back the loan.\ncaller: No, that's not it, the client comes first, we have to get our money from the client first.\nYeah, but that's not the issue right now, because the terms of Hyundai Capital are on our side, and Hyundai Capital has eight million yuan left.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: We're going to need you to send some of that money over there right away, so that when you get a confirmation from us, we'll be able to wire it to you.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: Yes, yes, yes, that's why I'm asking about the extent to which certain modifications are possible.\nreceiver: I'm going to change some things.\ncaller: It's going to be something like that.\nreceiver: I don't have that kind of money right now, so I hope it's not 15 million.\ncaller: Five hundred, so you're in a position where you're going to take the client first, and then you're gonna take the client from that side, and that's the take-away position, because that's how the client makes the money and doesn't make the money, so we're gonna go to Hyundai Capital first and ask for the deed first.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Our clients won't use your interest rate because it's too high, so they'll use ours at a lower rate, and we'll give them 20 million won.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So you send all the information about your clients to us, you do the paperwork, you send it to us, and we'll put it on the computer, we'll fax it to you.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: And then you're going to get a response, and it's going to go like this, and I'm going to call you back in a little bit.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: I'm going to call Modern Capital first, and I'll get back to you as soon as I get a reply from them, so just be a little bit prepared, just a little bit of preparation, just a pen and a note, and then once you call Modern Capital and tell them that I've got a replacement loan, they'll just give you a simple certificate of payment.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: What we need, what you or I need, is a legal receipt of payment, so we need to get it so we can move forward, so just wait a minute, can you make a deposit of five million dollars?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yeah, well, if you'll just wait a minute, I'm gonna go talk to the head of business requests, put your client's paperwork through Hyundai Capital, and I'll get back to you as soon as I hear back from you.\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: Twenty million won, and I'll raise you, sir.\nreceiver: Yeah, I got it.\ncaller: Yes, of course.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

Among them, I managed to confiscate a SBS bank receipt in the name of Mr. Choi Min-seok, which was used as an illegal receipt at the scene, and I compared the seized accounts with banks, and it was definitely confirmed as a receipt opened in your name.\nreceiver: Yeah, what bank?\ncaller: He's the head of a new bank.\nreceiver: Are you excited about the Strait?\ncaller: Have you recently lost your ID or your driver's license or your wallet or your passport?\nreceiver: I don't have one.\ncaller: So have you ever leaked your personal information on a website or anywhere else?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: You've never leaked your personal information, and this case involves more than 180 people across the country, including victims and perpetrators, so we're investigating, and in cases like this one, we've contacted you to find out if you're the perpetrator or the victim, and first of all, we'd like to ask you a few questions to identify whether you're an innocent victim or a perp.\nreceiver: Is that right?\ncaller: Are you uncomfortable talking to me?\nreceiver: It's not.\ncaller: Since your preliminary examination is being recorded, you are not allowed to make false or misleading statements. Do you know a 40-year-old man from Chongqing?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Do you know that on January 7th, 2015 you opened a new branch of the Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development at the Iron Sands branch in Guangdong?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Have you ever opened and sold your wallet financially?\nreceiver: No, you won't.\ncaller: Well, these two counters were either opened by you or stolen from you, and they were found at the checkpoint, so we've frozen them arbitrarily.\nreceiver: What's that?\ncaller: So, I don't know if you're the one who stole the bank receipts from the agricultural cooperative that was found at the scene, or if you opened them yourself, but do you have any interest in us going through the freezing process?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, I understand. So what financial instruments do you mainly use other than those found at the site of the Bank of China or Shinhan Bank? For the financial instruments you have opened yourself in the name of Mr. Choi Min-seok, please give a brief statement.\nreceiver: It's just that...\ncaller: Hi. How are you?\nreceiver: Yes, it's our bank. It's the bank, the cooperative, the Shinhan, the people, the Guangzhou Bank.\ncaller: Yes, so the financial institutions that you have personally opened are the Bank of China, the Bank of the Cooperation of Southeast Asia, the Shinhan Bank, the People's Bank, and the Guangzhou Bank, right?\nreceiver: Yes, yes, so how many accounts do you have in your bank and what do you use them for?\ncaller: Automatically relocated.\nreceiver: Automatic transfers? Yes, I understand. When you're transferring funds, how many accounts do you have, and what do you use them for, like in the case of the Agricultural Development Bank?\ncaller: I don't know.\nreceiver: I don't know how many straits there are.\ncaller: Don't you often use the Bank of Agriculture?\nreceiver: I don't know how many of them I use often.\ncaller: So now you have a number of these accounts at the Agricultural Development Bank and you need to know what they're used for, and there's an investigation going on, and if you're lying about any of the things that you've said, you could get hurt, so either you have to investigate, or you have to do this, or you come in and you have to be investigated, and you don't know how many accounts your carpenter has.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: So, can we have a meeting?\nreceiver: What's your crime?\ncaller: So if you have a number of accounts, you'll have to look at them yourself and submit them to us.\nreceiver: No, it's not possible right now.\ncaller: For now, just tell me what you remember.\ncaller: Two of them.\nreceiver: Two. What accounts do you have and what do you use them for?\ncaller: It's all automated.\nreceiver: What do you use it for?\ncaller: I don't know because I haven't used one.\nreceiver: I don't use it. I have one that I don' t use, and I don' T use all the others.\ncaller: The rest of you just open the drain and don't use it?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, so you don't have a checking account in the future?\nreceiver: There is.\ncaller: Now, you don't have any statements, but there's an AGRIC Bank AGRIC, which was recently created, and you have a recent deposit in the AGRIC bank, and you only have one account in our bank, is that correct?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

How do you get your salary entry? Demand. There's a year number on your receipt, and there's a salary entry underneath it. You have emergencies, which are usually cases where you're dealing with a politician, a celebrity, a drug case, a serial murder, a rape case, and so on. This is, as I said, a financial crime case, and financial crimes don't usually get a special rating, but this is the first case.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This is a very important case that we're working on, because we've identified a number of people who are currently on the list of suspects, in addition to those who have been investigated in the first instance, who are also working in the financial sector, and we're going to make this a very special case, because this is one of the financial cases that has been designated as a high-priority case. If you look at the summary below, it's going to be number one, two, three, four, and because this is an important part of the story, you're probably going to have a hard time understanding this part, too.\nreceiver: Is the receiver talking to me?\ncaller: Yes, it does.\nreceiver: And the guardian is the district attorney?\ncaller: Well, once you've read all of them, I'll make it easy for you to understand.\nreceiver: Well, I've read the whole thing, but it's a little hard.\ncaller: What's the part that you don't understand? Is this the fourth part that you're having trouble understanding?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Well, the second and third cases I explained earlier about how to investigate for proof of funds, that part where you go along and make sure that your own funds are clean personal assets of your own assets, and the fourth case where the direct receiver is going to do a freeze if you have passed on the execution of the investigation of this case to a third party, because as we said, there are parts that are still active that have not yet been censored, for example, by disclosing to third parties and leaking through SNS, media, etc., there is a concern about hijacking the funds of the victims, or even theft or embezzlement of the funds that have already been stolen, and we will proceed to close the pre-loan case if we find that there are allegations against the originator of this part.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Once you've been confirmed as a victim, it doesn't matter what you say in your family relationship, and besides, if there's a third party, it's the current status of the victim, and I'm telling them that they're not allowed to say anything, except for me and the current prosecutor, until they've been verified as a victim.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: If you'll look at the bottom, you'll be in direct contact with our chief prosecutor's office.\nreceiver: You're Kim Jin-tae, and you're in office.\ncaller: Yes, you're right.

How much battery do you have left in your phone right now?\nreceiver: It's charging and charging, and it's calling.\ncaller: Yes, you do. So how long would it take you approximately to prepare for your exit?\nreceiver: It's going to take about an hour.\ncaller: Can't you make it an hour or so faster, because it's just part of the banking process?\nreceiver: And within 20 minutes,\ncaller: Yes, you do that, and you're ready to go, and your phone is on the speakerphone, and besides the fact that the recording is updated once an hour, we all have to be recording, because there's this part where you switch the speakerphone and you've got to be ready to go. And from your current home location, how many minutes does it take approximately to get to the financial district of Samara?\nreceiver: I don't want to go to a bird farm near that house, so I'm gonna have to do some digging.\ncaller: First of all, I'm going to explain that to you again, and it's a one-day investigation fee, as I mentioned earlier, for any single penny that you incur while you're working with us, we're all paying for it through the investigation fee. You take a taxi, you have tea, you have a meal, we'll take care of all the parts, so you'll have to give us a receipt for all the parts. If you have difficulty in receiving a receipt, just tell me how much money has been spent on the record, and we'll check all these parts and pay you accordingly. And do you remember the investigator who called you the first time?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Whether it's a property insurance claim or a victim identification document, we're going to send all the documents to you personally, and we'll go through the process of explaining them to you, and then you'll be ready to leave, and I'll ask you to turn your phone on the speakerphone while it's charged, and if you have something important to tell me, I'll call you, so you can be prepared.\nreceiver: Wait a minute, so let me check this one more time, you're telling me that I need to have my I.D., I need to get my receipt, I need to be ready to leave, and I need to keep my speaker on?\ncaller: Yes, yes, yes, you can use that.\nreceiver: And now I'm going to have to do a little searching in the bird sanctuary that I can visit.\ncaller: First of all, where do you live, east of Seoul?\nreceiver: They live on the equator.\ncaller: Yeah, we're going to do some checking, so if you're ready, just let me know.\nreceiver: You got it.\ncaller: Are you ready?\nreceiver: I've got your exit ready.\ncaller: Yes, and we've just verified that there's a shrimp enclosure. Can you tell us where this translator is?\nreceiver: I'll have to look for it myself.\ncaller: Otherwise, if you take a taxi and tell the taxi driver, he'll know the nearest shrimp farm.\nreceiver: You don't know much about knights.\ncaller: First of all, let's use it as you know it and as you're comfortable with it, and you don't have the data set up right now.\nreceiver: No, not yet.\ncaller: Yes, this part of the verification process requires you to set it as a hold call, but I'm going to interrupt the recording for a moment, so please contact your carrier and set it to a hold call right now, as it won't take long to set up.\nreceiver: Is it because you've been contacted by the telecommunications company?\ncaller: So if you'd like to make a call to the 114, call the operator, call the 114, within the ars, it's going to be as simple as that, so go ahead and do that, and I'll call you back in a moment, so please set up.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

This is a store that has a good jewelry store, but I think that's a little too much, the law is wrong, the builder is wrong, I think it is a little difficult because my brother is also a foodie and he is preparing to open the store these days, but also my brother is a little worried about what will happen if this happens because of the building owner, and I think x is serious What do you think about this little prize building rental car protection law\nreceiver: I don't think the landlord is a bad person personally, but I think he's done nothing wrong legally. Legally, legally, I think it's more the fault of the barber who assaulted the man with a hammer than the owner of the building.\ncaller: That's what I think, and if there's no law, I think it's a little bit too much to raise that kind of exorbitant amount. Even couples who run barbershops have opened stores like this to make a living, and if they're paying more than they're making in sales or something like that, it's just that they're quitting the business.\nreceiver: I don't like to think badly of the landlord, but if the couple had gone to court instead of hitting them with a hammer, and the courts would have looked at the situation, and they would have made a ruling on the rent guarantee, and so on, I think it's absolutely punishable to go in there and swing a hammer or something like that, and the landlords would have suddenly raised the security deposit by more than 3 percent, 300 percent, 400 percent, and that's not very nice.\ncaller: Well, even if the couple had settled legally, seeing that the landlord has raised so much money, I just think the symbology is a little bit wrong, and, well, even if there was a court ruling, I think I would have raised a little bit of money later, slowly, anyway, well, if it were me, but I think it would have been a little bit rough, but I wonder if the property owner could poison the profits like this\nreceiver: When the landlord and the bailiff executed Mr. Kim, his finger was cut off by the owner of the barber shop, but I think we should see how this happened, and I think it's a bit too much for the barbershop to have tried to execute this kind of incident in the 20 degree cold winter, and well, in Japan and France, there is a policy that guarantees the tenant's rights to the property of the building owner only from the point of view of the owner, so I think we need such a system to increase the rights of tenants in our country as well.\ncaller: I'd like to see some sort of bill that protects the rights of the tenants, but I think the Congress or our country is a little bit more sympathetic to the rich people, and that's going to be a little bit unpleasant for the common people, so I'm hoping that some of these amendments will be passed by this Congress so that we can win each other over.\nreceiver: And, you know, other than this barbershop, there's a lot more of this kind of thing going on, and I've heard that the enforcement is done through private companies, and that if we had a little bit more involvement from the state and a little bit safer enforcement than private companies, maybe Mr. Kim wouldn't have gotten his fingers cut off, and I think we need a little bit of legislation on this, so if you're going to amend this law, how do you want to do it?\ncaller: I don't want to have to come up with this kind of a compromise and raise this kind of money just because the owners are building their own building and not just randomly raising it for their own benefit and just asking each other what the revenue is and how much they can afford and so on, but I want to go a little bit that way so that we can coordinate with each other, and if you were the head of the barbershop, how would you have prevented this kind of building tyranny?\nreceiver: Well, I think if I were the landlord, I'd file a civil suit in court, and I'd talk to that landlord in court and try to sort it out a little bit more safely and a little bit officially, a little bit like that, rather than swinging a hammer, and I think we'd have to legally guarantee the rights of tenants, just like in developed countries, whereas in Japan, when there's a conflict between a landlord refusing to renew a lease and a tenant renewing a lease, the courts decide on the basis of which party is more culpable, because our country shouldn't have done this, and it shouldn't.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}

Do I have to go to the main branch?\nreceiver: You can go anywhere.\ncaller: Is there any way my husband can go instead of me, and if I take my parole officer and my parole certificate, is there any way I can get a replacement?\nreceiver: You have to come.\ncaller: Do I have to issue certificates to each bank that I'm dealing with, or can I just have one?\nreceiver: You can only issue one bank.\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: I have a valid credit card issued by another bank, and it's probably expired because I haven't used it for a long time, but can I just ignore that and get a new valid credit card from another bank?\nreceiver: You can get a new one.\ncaller: But it's a little complicated, because you have to renew it every year, and there's no way you can continue to use it without renewing it.\nreceiver: You don't have to renew your universal credential.\ncaller: I'm a little old, so can I go with my kid for a little explanation?\ncaller: I'm a little nervous about whether the credentials are secure, whether they can be hacked.\nreceiver: Yes, you are safe.\ncaller: I wonder if I could just borrow it for my family after I've made the certificates, because I'm so busy.\nreceiver: Not at all.\ncaller: Uh-huh. Do you have to write it yourself?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: What do you do when you want to renew a valid ID card? I saw on the website that you can renew your ID card at home, without going to the bank.\nreceiver: Yes, you can.\ncaller: Is it easy to renew? Can you just do it on the bank's website?\ncaller: If you have a valid ID, can you transfer money to another bank?\ncaller: Are the transfer fees free?\nreceiver: It's free.\ncaller: Is there a limit on how much you can transfer in a day?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: Is the amount that can be remitted redeemable at a later date?\nreceiver: Let's say you want to be a yes/no.\ncaller: Is there a limit to how many transfers you can send in a day?\nreceiver: There's no set number of times, there's a set amount.\ncaller: If you had a valid ID, you could use it for the IRS's year-end calculations, and you had to log in with a valid ID.\nreceiver: You're free if you bring your ID.\ncaller: Is there a fee to create a valid ID? It's free, but if you sign up for free, it's okay to send money or log in to the IRS?\nreceiver: It's all right.\ncaller: A general-purpose certificate is for a private entrepreneur who can do all kinds of work and doesn't need to renew it once a year, right?\nreceiver: Yes, that's right.\ncaller: So it's a much broader scope than a free validated certificate, right?\nreceiver: That's right, there's a wider range of uses.\ncaller: It's obviously a little bit more complicated because it's so versatile, but can't we make it simpler?\nreceiver: Yes, I'm sorry, but you have to be prepared for security.\ncaller: You're supposed to have a three-year/three-year validity period, you don't have to reissue it, and you get a 40%/40% discount, right?\nreceiver: The discount varies depending on the release date.\nreceiver: No. Three years over three years is the maximum.\ncaller: I don't like anything about it.\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: If you apply in person, will you be released on the same day?\nreceiver: It's available on the same day.\ncaller: Yes, thank you for your reply.

I'm about to issue a new card.\ncaller: What do I have to do to qualify for a card? I'm just a housewife with no income, and of course my spouse is currently employed.\ncaller: Yeah, I'm worried about the new issuance standards these days, because they say you can't do that if you don't have an income, and you said you look at credit scores, but did you ever see that when you were issuing cards?\nreceiver: You have your standards.\ncaller: Oh, and this is how I found out that I had a credit card that had a personal credit rating of less than one-tenth of a day.\ncaller: There's a possibility of a new release.\ncaller: (Laughter)\ncaller: It wasn't a loan, so I just broke it off.\ncaller: Is it the same here?\nreceiver: It varies from person to person.\ncaller: I recently took out a loan, and my credit went straight from two to six, so I asked.\ncaller: Or maybe it's not my income, it's my spouse's income.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: I see on your website that you have to pay more than $30,000 a month in insurance and property taxes?\ncaller: I think my spouse is spending about 70000 won/70000 won on healthcare and 120,000 won/10000 won on Social Security.

I'll tell you how much interest we can get for 10 million.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Hi, there.\ncaller: Thank you for waiting, and if you do, I'm sorry, but your credit score is very low, and it's a pity, but even if you use our product, you'll only get 4% interest.\nreceiver: Oh, I don't know about that.\ncaller: If there's one thing I can do for you, sir, and it's a little bit of a legal matter, because I'm in the middle of a sale this month, so I'd like you to do it for me.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, please understand that, but if you contact our bank's advice desk, it will be impossible, and if you make a mistake, the sale of the goods will not be possible at all.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: In fact, we have a legal team of lawyers who provide proof of income for our bank, and if you have a bad credit score and you're a little short on repayment, we can give you a loan from our bank at a discount, because you've been honestly repaying your loans, and from our bank's point of view, that's a healthy customer.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: So, you're a good customer and we're a great bank, but it's just a way to get your credit score up a little bit more legally in advance of any increase, so if the lawyers on our legal team sign off on it, then we'll guarantee your credit, because that's how it works, so if you submit it to the credit rating agency with your return statement, it'll be reviewed within a week, and your credit score will go up quite a bit.\nreceiver: Oh, please.\ncaller: Yeah, and then a week later, you'll be able to use our product right away, at almost 2.6% interest.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: And your lawyer doesn't even give you an affidavit.\nreceiver: Yes, you are.\ncaller: You know, it's a lot of fees if you put your lawyer's name on it, but we can make it a little bit cheaper and get you a receipt for $300,000, so if you send your client's income statement and the receipt to your lawyer and you pay $300,000 as a receipt, that's a receipt.\nreceiver: How much is that?\ncaller: Your client, would you please try?\nreceiver: Yeah, but $300,000 is a bit of a burden.\ncaller: Yes, but the interest rate on the new loan would then go down to 2.6 percent, which would be a huge benefit to your client's household, and that's a lot better when you think about it.\nreceiver: Yeah, uh, do I have to order this today?\ncaller: Yeah, well, it takes a week to get certified, to get a credit rating, and if it's longer, it's a little difficult because our products are temporary.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, can I put it into your lawyer's account?\ncaller: Well, I'll send you the contact information of our lawyers, and if you call me Kim Min-soo, and you say you want an income certificate for a product, you know that, and you pay the certificate fee, but if you contact our bank's customer service, they'll probably say they don't know because it's illegal, and that's the only part you should be aware of.\nreceiver: What about your lawyer's contact information?\ncaller: Do you have your notes?\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: This is 010-2813-1239.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\ncaller: Yes, yes, please contact me.\nreceiver: Yes, you did.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}], "label": 1, "cut_pct": 0}

What's the tax rate?\ncaller: So the houses that we're looking at are between 6,000 and 100,000,000.\nreceiver: What happens to the loan amount?\ncaller: It's about 4,000 to 8,000.\nreceiver: So you're not done writing the world charter yet?\ncaller: Yeah, I haven't written it yet.\nreceiver: Are you the one who wants to borrow money?\ncaller: It's you.\nreceiver: What's the income going to be?\ncaller: It's been less than a year since the store opened, and we haven't seen any income.\nreceiver: Yeah, well, let me know what your monthly payments are for your local health plan.\ncaller: It's about minus 25,000.\nreceiver: What about generations?\ncaller: This is me.\nreceiver: Have you paid for more than three months?\ncaller: Yes, he did.\nreceiver: What was your combined credit card and checking account usage last year?\ncaller: It's about a billion to two billion yuan.\nreceiver: If you're under the age of 34, or if you're a married couple, do you qualify for a polygamous marriage?\ncaller: You're under 34 years old, and you have a deaf child in your care.\nreceiver: What about home ownership?\ncaller: They're homeless.\nreceiver: Have you ever borrowed anything?\ncaller: I have $5 million in student loans, and I have $30 million in credit union business loans.\nreceiver: What kind of house is it that you're moving into, an apartment, an office, a multi-family home, a condo?\ncaller: We're looking at multi-generational housing or office buildings.\nreceiver: Where are you moving to?\ncaller: This is Seoul.\nreceiver: Do you know your credit score?\ncaller: We were rated second-rate by the credit union when we applied for the loan.\nreceiver: What's the approximate date of the move?\ncaller: It's crazy because the house hasn't been fixed yet.\nreceiver: I've checked your basics, and I was wondering if you could fill me in on the details.\ncaller: As you said, we opened our shop in December last year, and we're managing it as a general manager. We've filed our income tax returns and our expense tax returns, but we haven't earned any income yet because we've been operating for less than a year.\ncaller: In January of next year, we'll be able to file an income tax return because we've been operating for a pig year, but according to our tax returns, it's almost impossible for the bank to refund the income.\ncaller: Well, first of all, let's do some research, and what we found was a tax-advantaged home loan, and this doesn't show any income, but it looks like it's going to be at least $3,000 for the unemployed.\ncaller: So you go to the homepage, you type in all this information, and you look at it, and theoretically, it's going to say, 27,700,000 dollars.\ncaller: But with the money I have and the additional loan of 3,000, I think it's going to be hard to buy as many houses as I want, so I want to borrow some more.\ncaller: I'm going to go with 2 to 3 percent.\ncaller: We haven't really defined the powerhouse yet, but we want to go to at least 5,000 to 100,000,000 powerhouses.\ncaller: If you go to the bank and talk to them, you have to come to their house and give them an address and do a search, and then you have to know roughly how much they're going to borrow, and it's not that easy to look for a home based on that amount, but you want to know how much you can borrow roughly.\nreceiver: It's true what they say about banks: the borrowing limit is determined by the home equity and the credit rating.\ncaller: Oh, is that so?\nreceiver: So you have to go to the charging station to find out what your credit limit is.\ncaller: Is it possible to borrow more than 3000?\nreceiver: If it's just credit and a pre-owned house, 3,000 is certainly possible.\ncaller: So, yes, we would like to make loans only to banks or accredited institutions that are in the first place, and we want to avoid these kinds of large mortgages, is that possible?\nreceiver: Yes, it's possible in financial sector one.\ncaller: If the battery is good, what's the limit? What's the interest?\nreceiver: The interest rate is 2 to 3 percent, 80 to 90 percent of the full amount, up to 400 million yuan.\ncaller: I can prove my income, and I'm paying a lot of money for health care, but what do I have to prove my income to get a loan?\ncaller: It depends on the limit, so if you submit both the business and the health plan, and you check your financials, can you confirm the limit? There's an expectation, but we've almost paid it all.\ncaller: You have my name on your business license, and your business status is normal.\ncaller: And then I'll prepare the paperwork, like the business registration, the financial statements, the application form, and the Global Compact Agreement, and I'll apply.\ncaller: Can we get the results back on the same day?\ncaller: All right, I'll let you do the autopsy.\ncaller: Do you think it's possible for a husband and wife to share the same name?\ncaller: It's a copy, is it?\ncaller: So the loan and the mortgage have to be identical, but can they be co-signed?\ncaller: Yes thank you.

Instead of creating jobs, the effect of increasing the wages was not to hire people in order to reduce human costs.\nreceiver: And that's why it's so hard to find a job, because it's very hard to get a job. Of course, it's not important to put up a pie, but it's also very important to create a place where you can relax, and it used to be that Saturday wasn't a day of mourning, but now you can have two days of rest, and even working students in the lowest class have a guaranteed time to relax.\ncaller: The population is shrinking, the elderly population is growing, and I think the problem of low productivity is serious, because low productivity reduces the labor force, and at the same time it reduces the jobs that low-income people can do, such as sound work, cleaning, and so on, to jobs that are now being done by real illegal aliens or immigrants from abroad, and the number of unemployed people is going up in the billionaire zone, and the construction costs are going up, and we thought it would be economically beneficial, but I don't know if that's part of the income-driven growth policy, but it turns out that all the machines that are called kiosks are doing what people used to do instead, so if you go to a coffee shop and there's not a single employee, they're automating everything, and you only see one person in the coffee shop, and they've got to have a robot to do everything instead, and we've seen it in the movies, and it's pretty simple, all the things that people have to do are dependent on machines, and they don't have to meet\nreceiver: I think it's a good thing that machines are doing what people do, and I think that's a very good thing, because in the past, when we had the IMF, we didn't pay less and hire more people, we restructured, and a lot of people left the company, they retired honorably from the banks that they really believed in, and they came out and did that, and the problem is that machines are good, but now we have to create a lot of new jobs, and the president's philosophy is that people come first.\ncaller: Well, there's more casual jobs in big corporations, and there's fewer and fewer casual jobs, and it's not that corporate profits are too important. I read an article yesterday about the chairman of a turkey company, and that turkey even has a full-time job at a corner grocery store, and that's why it's called a turkey. So, the more profit generated by a company, the more income distributed to employees, how many of those companies do you have? There's more and more inequality between the poor and the rich. Apartment prices have gone up by a dozen or so times. And yet, even though the middle class is now earning poorer incomes than ever before, the cost of living is going up, the house prices are going up, all sorts of things are going up.

I'm calling to ask you about my credit card mileage.\nreceiver: Please provide your name and contact information for accurate guidance.\nreceiver: Thank you for checking in. Can I help you?\ncaller: I'm confused about how to use miles plus mileage, so let me know how many points I have, because I've been writing my own cards and collecting my own mileage, and I'm kind of confused.\nreceiver: (Fifty thousand points) / (Ten thousand points) is confirmed.\ncaller: I'm just going to give you O+ (fifty thousand points) /O (twenty thousand points) and I'll give you some more. Did you check your name and your card correctly? My card number is 1234, 5678, 9012, 3456, and it's a better credit card.\nreceiver: This card is [50000 points] over [0000 points].\ncaller: Recently, I spent a few days in a luxury restaurant (100,000 won) /100,000 won) hotel to go out to eat, and I paid with this card (500,000 won/500,000 won) to win a national tour event and go on a trip (5000000 won) /500,000 won. I spent so much, but it's only (50000p) /50 points. I don't understand why? I've spent so much on the terms and conditions that I know that the more points I accumulate, the more I've used, and I can't really understand why this happened.\nreceiver: I'm going to take you to 50,000 points/8,000 points.\ncaller: A: How much did you spend? It's only 50,000 points. It's a minimum of 100,000 points. A: I have another bullet-proof credit card.\nreceiver: Please confirm your card number.\ncaller: It's the number of days in a year. It's one day, two days, three days.\nreceiver: So this is going to be 40000 points over 40000 points.\ncaller: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I had all the points on one card, but I wrote a bunch of these cards together, and then I added up all the sharing cards to get the points, and I'm confused because I'm getting older and my memory is getting worse.\ncaller: So what about the mileage? (1 year) / (one year) or (2 years) / (this year)? I think I've seen it in the pharmacy. I think it's a real memory loss.\ncaller: If you look at the terms and conditions, you know that you can use it in a bookstore, a movie theater, a restaurant, a hotel, etc. Why can't you use it for cost reasons plus airplanes? It's nice to be able to use it with airline mileage, but can you also link this? Usually, the transportation system is the subway or KTX, SRT, ESLT, so why can't the airlines connect?\ncaller: If you have a lot of mileage, it's going to save you money and make it easier for you to get around, so why don't you negotiate with the airline and make the airplane available?\nreceiver: Sorry about that.\ncaller: When I asked you before, you said you'd take care of this too, so why don't you always? If you want to help your customer's convenience, you have to check and reflect on these suggestions.\ncaller: How reflective is it? Is it still being negotiated? Is it going to be done by the middle of the year? The answer is yes. You have to reflect these things properly, use them lightly, and put cards around them.\nreceiver: I'll pass it on to the person in charge.\ncaller: If you don't use it by the deadline, you can use it for the next month, and if it's lost, it'll be remembered and used for another month.\ncaller: And if you can keep using the expiration number next year or next month, and the customer remembers that they didn't use it, and it's linked to a card payment, you want to keep using this card, right?\ncaller: And that's a good thing, because the next time you're going to use it, you'll be able to keep it on schedule, and you won't have to make any unnecessary purchases, and you'll also be able to help your household plus your household, and I think the sharing card is really good in that respect, compared to other card companies, because you know, the Trump card expired, and for some reason, you couldn't use it again, and you didn't really want to use it.\nreceiver: Any unused points can be used later.\ncaller: And it's a sharing card, so if my family or friends give me a mileage, can I use it? I usually don't want to use it, or it's inconvenient, but there's a lot of people around who give me miles or give me a ride, and it's not in the terms and conditions, so I'm going to ask the counselor.\nreceiver: Both are possible.\ncaller: Is it really possible? W/Sharing cards are very flexible in terms of how they handle this plus part. You know, we usually ask a lot of these questions when we get our third-party mileage vouchers. For some reason, we ask a lot about what points, when, where, and how they're used, and there's a lot of verification procedures, and when we're checking out, I get really annoyed when people ask me this and that in the store.\ncaller: I'm really glad you're letting me use this.\nreceiver: That's right.\ncaller: So I can use my card or someone else's card together, even if I have multiple shared cards in my name, and I can overlap the mileage with a (1) / (a) card, and someone else has a shared card mileage that I have legitimate permission to use, and that card mileage is linked to my card, and of course I can accumulate additional mileage?\ncaller: But there were some places where the use market was in every branch and some places where it wasn't. Why is that? The card company should make it available in all the stores.\ncaller: He really liked his coffee, and he wanted to order a bigger one and give it to her as a gift, and then he had to go to the Trump Hotel and pay for it, and there was a mileage limit, and he couldn't use it all, which was really uncomfortable.\nreceiver: It varies from store to store.\ncaller: So, as much as possible, if the store is the same, we have to make it available everywhere, and if not, there are a lot of problems with fairness and access. Sometimes when you pay with drive-thru, the kiosk doesn't work, and the sharing card has a long loading + loading time, and it's a pity, but it's nice to see that it's evolving a little bit, so from the customer's point of view.\nreceiver: A: I will try.\ncaller: But if you could send me a monthly mileage estimate via text message, email, or chat like SNS/SNS, would that be helpful? I think it's discriminatory who comes and who doesn't, even if you have marketing consent.\ncaller: I'm sorry about that, but I'm also sorry about the fact that it's like a letter of introduction, so please do it when you apply.\nreceiver: Yes, I got it.\ncaller: I would like you to send me a text message on the 15th of each month. No, please send it by e-mail. The message could be mistakenly treated as spam, so the e-mail for Sharing Card is not spam-processed and can be verified by e-mails on the 15 th of each month, so please send it to 123@.com.\nreceiver: Yes, I see.\ncaller: I've been asking a lot of questions, and I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm always using a sharing card, and I think my mom is making noise because she doesn't have it, so please refer me to the person in charge of this and help me make it less awkward to use.\nreceiver: I will try.\ncaller: If you have any further questions about mileage, we'll get back to you.\nreceiver: Thank you. Do you have any other questions?\ncaller: No, I don't. I'll call you next time I have a question.\nreceiver: Thank you.

If you have money, you can build a lot of facilities like this. So in Japan, at the age of 40, the health insurance premium is included in the health insurance fee. So the insurance fee is a little expensive, but if the people who benefit from it are more patients, I think it's also very good.\n</conversation>\nReminder: Based on the system instructions, output ONLY \"True\" or \"False\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}], "label": 0, "cut_pct": 0}
